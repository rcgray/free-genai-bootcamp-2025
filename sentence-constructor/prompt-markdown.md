# Markdown Prompt

The following is a prompt for the Sentence Creator feature catering toward LLMs that prefer Plaintext (or Markdown) formats.
- **Target Models:** This should work best with older and pre-transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2).
- **Development:** It was developed with the help of Claude Sonnet 3.5 and DeepSeek R1.
- **Testing:** This prompt has been evaluated on the following models:
  - ✅ Claude Sonnet 3.5 - (included concluding thoughts)
  - ✅ ChatGPT-4o - ("let me know if you need anything else")
  - ✅ DeepSeek V3 - (included concluding thoughts)
  - ✅ Microsoft Phi-4 14B Q6_K_L - (included concluding thoughts)
  - ✅ Qwen2.5 14B Instruct 1M Q6_K_L - (included concluding thoughts)
  - ✨ **Mistral Small 24B Instruct 2501 13B Q6_K_L - (✅perfect✅)**
  - ✅ DeepSeek R1 - 🧠51s - (included concluding thoughts)
  - 🟨 DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B Q6_K_L - 🧠7s - (good translation, missed kanji in the analysis)
  - ❌ DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen2.5 1.5B Q6_K_L - 🧠2s - (attempted, but garbled/incomplete)
- **Criteria:** that it is expected there will be some surrounding boilerplate on instruct models, tests pass if it's reasonable that simple post-processing could get everything it needed from the response.

## Example Notes
  - Example 1 represents a simple request where no Version was specified (so Standard was assumed by default) and where the Translation, Romanization, and Kanji Analysis were provided as requested.
  - Example 2 shows a beginner version request where the standard Translation may have been something like "来週またお会いできたらと思います。" to reflect the speech of a native Japanese speaker.  However, this native version uses: (1) お会い (oai) - the honorific form of 会う (au), (2) できたら (dekitara) - potential conditional form, and (3) と思います (to omoimasu) - adding indirectness/softness. In contrast, the beginner version translation "来週にまた会いたいです。" uses: (1) 会いたい (aitai) - simple desire form, (2) に (ni) - explicit time particle that's often dropped by natives, and consists of a more straightforward structure.
  - Example 3 shows a beginner version request with no Style specified (so Polite was assumed by default) where the standard Translation may have been something like "会議に遅れまして申し訳ございません。" to reflect the speech of a native Japanese speaker.  However, this native version uses: (1) 申し訳ございません (moushiwake gozaimasen) - more formal apologetic form, and (2) まして (mashite) - polite connecting form. In contrast, the beginner version translation "会議に遅くなってすみません。" uses: (1) すみません (sumimasen) - basic but perfectly polite apologetic form, (2) 遅くなって (osoku natte) - more literal "became late" construction, and consists of a more straightforward grammar structure.
  - Example 4 shows a beginner version request where the standard Translation may have been something like "もう一度ご説明いただけますでしょうか。" to reflect the speech of a native Japanese speaker.  However, this native version uses: (1) ご説明 (go-setsumei) - honorific prefix, (2) いただけます (itadakemasu) - humble form for receiving, and (3) でしょうか (deshou ka) - softer question form. In contrast, the beginner version translation "もう一度説明してくださいませんか。" uses: (1) してください (shite kudasai) - basic polite request form, (2) ませんか (masen ka) - straightforward negative question pattern, and no honorific prefix on 説明 (setsumei).
  - Example 5 represents a simple request of a longer sentence where neither the Style nor the Version was specified (so Polite style and Standard version were assumed by default) and where the Translation, Romanization, and Kanji Analysis were provided as requested.

## Quality Checks

- Ensure all kanji are analyzed
- Confirm cultural appropriateness
- Validate particle usage
- Check for proper honorific usage

## Notes
