00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Mikuriya Japanese Podcast

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.280
Everyone, Happy New Year!

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.799
By the time you're listening to this, I think it's already January 1st,

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:32.799
and it's still December when I'm recording this, so I haven't had a new year yet,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:38.639
but I think it's already 2025 for those of you who are listening to this in the future.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.119
Yes, Happy New Year!

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:46.080
Everyone, this is the first episode of the year.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.080
Do you have any New Year's resolutions?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.639
Have you ever heard of a New Year's resolution?

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.080
You may have heard of it in my podcast,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.480
but a New Year's resolution is a goal for this year.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.239
What do you want to do this year? What kind of goal do you want to achieve this year?

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.400
You think about it and make a New Year's resolution.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.599
I'm the type of person who doesn't make a New Year's resolution.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.720
Because even if I make a New Year's resolution,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.720
I will forget that New Year's resolution after April.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.239
I remember it until January, February, and March,

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:35.760
but I forget it in April, so I realized that there is no point in making a New Year's resolution.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.440
Since then, I haven't made a New Year's resolution at all.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.599
What is your New Year's resolution?

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.720
If you can't make a New Year's resolution, what do you want to do this year?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.519
I can't make a New Year's resolution,

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:59.919
but I'm trying to think about how I want to live this year and what I want to cherish this year.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:03.120
So, in today's episode,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.639
First, I would like to share the questions I looked back on last year and the questions I will ask myself this year.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:21.199
You often say that good quality questions make a good quality life, right?

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.880
So, I came up with five questions today.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.039
Okay, so the first one.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:37.839
What do you think you are proud of looking back on last year?

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.119
Before we talk about this year,

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:46.160
let's think about what you have achieved or worked hard for last year.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.919
It doesn't matter if it's small, so let's think about it.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:58.559
Well, when we look back on a year, we usually reflect on it, right?

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:04.320
I think we think, oh, this wasn't good, or I should have done this a little more,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.960
but I don't think I think about what I did my best and what I'm proud of.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.320
So, I'm going to stop this podcast here,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.199
and I want you to ask yourself three things that you are proud of.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:31.440
Well, I think there are quite a few people who go on to the next project without celebrating what they have achieved, right?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240
I was like that too.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.440
It's important to reflect on and analyze what you have failed,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.440
but I think it's just as important to celebrate what you have achieved.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.199
So, I think it's better to think about what you have worked hard for a year and give yourself a reward.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:04:01.039
For example, when you work hard, you can go to a convenience store and buy a cheesecake that is more expensive than usual.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.919
I think it's better to give yourself a reward.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:17.279
I don't think it's easy to praise yourself for what you've done in this busy modern society,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.399
so think of this as a good opportunity.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:29.040
Before you think about this year, first look back at last year.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.399
Do you look back at the end of the year?

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:39.279
I look back at what I've learned this year, what I've worked hard for this year,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.880
and what I thought I should improve a little more,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.839
but do you look back at the end of the year?

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:55.679
I personally feel that looking back at the end of the year is more important than building a new year's resolution.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:01.920
It's the same for me, but I think there are a lot of things I've learned over the year,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:11.839
so I think it's a good idea to write them down in a notebook or record them in a voice memo for yourself.

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.320
That's the first question.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.440
The second question I want you to ask yourself is your current state.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:46.480
I want you to think about your current health, your current relationship with people, your current financial situation, your current work situation, and your current play situation in five categories.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480
First of all, your health.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.679
How is your current state of health, everyone?

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:56.640
I think I ate a little too much chocolate.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:05.519
It's better not to eat too much sweets, but I regret that I ate too much sweets last year.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:07.119
How about you guys?

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:09.359
Did you exercise?

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:15.279
I started going to the gym and doing muscle training, but it's pretty tough.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.720
I've only done aerobic exercise so far.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.399
Aerobic exercise is running, walking, swimming, etc.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.239
It's an exercise that burns fat.

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:33.519
Muscle training is a non-oxygen exercise.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.640
What was it? Was it non-oxygen? I forgot a little.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.440
I've never done muscle training with a machine in earnest, so I'm learning a lot right now.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.119
I want to continue that.

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.200
Muscles are important after all.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:58.320
When I was young, I was fine without doing anything, but as I get older, I get more and more tired.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.239
I think it's easier to get tired because the amount of muscle is decreasing.

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:11.519
I felt a little less tired after I started muscle training, so I want to do my best with muscle training.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.559
How is your current health?

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.600
The same goes for eating. How is your eating?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.640
Are you eating something good for your body?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.839
How about exercise? What kind of exercise are you doing?

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:32.399
My gym trainer said that if I didn't exercise four times a week, I would lack exercise.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.239
Lack of exercise means that you don't exercise enough.

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:43.600
It's okay if you do it four times a week, but isn't four times a week quite a lot?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.119
When I first heard about it, I was surprised to hear that you need to exercise four times a week to lack exercise.

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:57.279
That's how modern people don't exercise enough, right?

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:04.079
How many points out of five do you rate your health?

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:08.559
I think I'm four out of five.

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:18.399
After all, I eat too much sweets, bread, and flour, so I have to be careful about that.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:30.480
It seems that you should think about a concrete method to analyze your current health and make it better this year.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.520
A concrete method is what you actually do.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.359
For example, the goal of going to the gym is not concrete at all.

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:43.760
How many times a week do you go to the gym?

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.880
What time do you go to the gym?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.400
It seems that it is important to think about these things concretely.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.960
And it is important to put it into action this year.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.960
The second one is human relations.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.960
How many points out of five do you rate your relationship with people?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.679
Are you satisfied?

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:21.200
Relationship with family, relationship with partner, relationship with children, relationship with friends...

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.280
How is it?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:30.640
After all, it seems that human relations are the most important thing to be happy.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:44.000
I think it's a good idea to rethink your current relationship and think about a concrete method to build a better relationship with your loved ones this year.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.880
For example, if you want to build a deeper relationship with your friends,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.719
I think about how to build a deeper relationship with your friends.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:10:00.000
What kind of activities can I do to have a deeper conversation?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.400
Also, for example, if the human relationship at work is not good now,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.159
I think it's a good idea to think about how to make it better.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.719
I don't think it's necessary to make it better.

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:15.119
If you want to get along with people at work,

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:18.000
If you want to get along with your colleagues,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.479
I think it's a good idea to think about what you should do.

00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:25.840
For example, invite everyone to a drink party,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.080
I think it's okay to go bowling with everyone.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.880
I think it's a good idea to think about how to get along with that person more specifically.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.679
The next category is money.

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:43.520
I think it's a good idea to think about how to spend your money now.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.080
What am I spending too much money on?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.320
On the contrary, I think it's a good idea to think about what you should invest more of your money in.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.479
Investing means...

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:57.359
I think some people invest in stocks,

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:00.880
I think some people invest in themselves,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.119
It means spending money.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:09.359
For example, if you think your current way of spending your money is not good,

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:16.799
I think it's a good idea to think about how to make your money better.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:19.440
Next, work.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.440
How many points out of 5 do you think you are satisfied with your job?

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.719
Well, I think people have different values,

00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:32.159
If you don't think your job is that important in your life,

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:36.400
There's no problem with 2 or 1 out of 5 points.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.760
I think it's a good idea to think that your job is for making money.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.320
If you're in a business now,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.679
I think it's a good idea to analyze your current job.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:58.159
I think it's a good idea to think about how to make your job better or more fun.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:02.000
Next, play.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.479
I think some people want to make their play out of 5 points because it's okay to have 2 points for work.

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:11.599
Did you play a lot last year?

00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:14.159
Did you make time to play?

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:16.799
I think there are a lot of busy people,

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:19.119
Playing is really important.

00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:24.960
I think it's really important to make time to play.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.479
I used to be a workaholic,

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:31.119
I only worked,

00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:34.080
I've been playing a lot lately.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.840
The priorities have changed,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.440
I realized that work is important, but playing is also important.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.400
I think I'm playing a lot.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.840
Playing is not just playing with friends,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.200
For example, enjoying your hobby time,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.080
It's about doing what you like,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.599
For example, if you like to do creative things,

00:12:59.599 --> 00:13:04.880
How do you use your creativity now?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.960
Creativity is about creativity.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.320
Thinking about how you play in your life,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.039
What should I do to play more this year?

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:20.479
I think it will be a more fun year.

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:24.719
Even if you say play, I think it depends on the person.

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:27.200
I think some people want to play with their friends,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.599
I want to read a lot of books alone.

00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:30.880
This is also a play.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.960
If you like to read books,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.679
It will be a play, I think anything is fine.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:40.239
Thinking about how long you've been doing what you like in your life,

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:45.200
If you feel like you don't have enough time to play,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.359
How can I increase my play time?

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:54.559
I think it's good to think about how to play more.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.119
This is the second question.

00:13:57.119 --> 00:14:01.440
There were five categories for the second question, so it's a little long.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:10.239
I think it's good to think about health, relationships, money, work, and play.

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:14.239
This is the second thing I want you to ask yourself.

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:18.000
Are you having fun studying Japanese?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.880
It's hard to study grammar alone using textbooks,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.039
I think there are many people who are busy and don't have time to study.

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:40.559
So I made a grammar shadowing audio course so that everyone can study Japanese while doing something like commuting, housework, or taking a walk.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:48.799
If you take this course, you will not only learn grammar, many words, and expressions, but also improve your speaking skills.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:54.559
In this course, I practice a lot of Japanese sentences in my head,

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:59.039
and then I practice shadowing by speaking out loud,

00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:04.799
so my pronunciation improves and it's a little easier to speak Japanese.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:08.640
So far, a lot of people have taken this course.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.679
A lot of people have taken this course and have become more confident in their Japanese.

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:19.359
If you want to connect with a lot of people in Japanese,

00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:25.039
if you want to actually be able to speak Japanese, please take this course.

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:28.719
You can try it for free, so if you'd like, please give it a try.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.919

なんでこんな質問をみなさんにシェアしてるかというと、

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.199
やっぱり私も含めて、

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:08.000
意識しないと同じことを繰り返してしまうのが人間だと思うんですよね。

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.359
無意識のまま同じことを繰り返すのが人間。

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:18.959
だから、新年の抱負を立てるのも素敵なことなんですけど、

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:22.239
自分が今どんな価値観を持ってて、

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:28.160
何を優先したいのかを考えることってすごく大事だと思うんですよ。

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.239
自分の時間を本当に大切にするために。

00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:34.719
っていうのはさっきもちょっと言ったんですけど、

00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:37.760
時間ってどんどんどんどん過ぎるじゃないですか。

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.800
で、本当にどうでもいいことに2,3時間使っちゃったなっていうことって、

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800
人間誰でもあると思うんですよ。

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800
私もあるんですけど。

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:53.839
でも、年の始めにこうやって、自分は今年はどんなことを大切にしたいかなとか、

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:59.359
今年はどんな人と一緒に過ごしたいかなって考えることで、

00:24:59.359 --> 00:25:05.520
時間を自分にとって大切じゃないことに使わなくて済むと思うんですよね。

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:12.400
使ってしまうかもしれないんだけど、毎日それを繰り返すことはなくなると思う。

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:16.959
本当に時間って戻ってこないし、

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:21.280
時間はお金で買えるものでもないから、

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.680
自分にとって大切なこととか、

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:32.239
自分が優先したいことに使うのが一番満足できる時間の使い方かなと思います。

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:37.760
皆さん、このポッドキャスト聞いたあとでもいいので、

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.079
この5つの質問を自分にしてみてください。

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:43.359
もう一回言いますよ。

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:48.880
1番目、去年1年間振り返って自分を誇りに思うことは何?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.560
2つ目、今の自分の健康はどうかな?

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.520
今の自分の人間関係はどうかな?

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.640
今の自分のお金の状況はどうかな?

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.119
今の自分の仕事はどうかな?

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:03.520
今の自分の遊びはどうかな?

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.319
この5つを考えてみてください。

00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:09.920
3つ目は、誰と成功を分かち合えるか。

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.439
誰がつらいときも、自分が成功したときも、そばにいてくれるか。

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:19.119
4つ目は、自分にとって本当に大切なことは何か。

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:23.839
で、その自分が大切なことをどうやったら優先できるか。

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:29.199
で、5つ目、最後は、考えるだけでワクワクすることは何か。

00:26:29.199 --> 00:26:32.400
はい、この5つを考えてみてください。

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.400
私も新年が明けたら、自分にこの質問をしてみたいと思います。

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.640
みなさんは、これを聞いているのは1月1日だと思うので、

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.359
時間があったら、時間があったらとは言わずに、

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:49.920
ぜひ、この質問を自分にしてみてください。

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.119
