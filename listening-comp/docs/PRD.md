# Japanese Listening Learning Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Japanese Listening Learning Tool is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users learn Japanese through audio content. The application allows users to input podcast URLs, processes the audio to create transcripts in both Japanese and English, and provides an interactive learning experience through AI-powered speech synthesis.

## Problem Statement
Learning Japanese through authentic content (e.g., podcasts) can be challenging due to:
- Difficulty in following native-speed speech
- Lack of immediate access to translations
- Limited ability to practice listening at a comfortable pace
- Need for simultaneous reading and listening practice

## Solution
Our application addresses these challenges by providing:
- Automated transcription of Japanese audio content
- English translations of the content
- AI-powered speech synthesis for improved comprehension
- Interactive transcript navigation with instant translations

## Core Features

### 1. Content Input
- Accept URLs from various platforms (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, etc.)
- Support for different audio formats
- Input validation and error handling
- Progress indication during download

### 2. Audio Processing
- Download and store audio files securely
- Convert audio to required format for processing
- Implement speech-to-text (STT) for Japanese content
- Generate accurate timestamps for transcription

### 3. Transcription & Translation
- Generate Japanese transcripts using AI STT
- Provide English translations using AI translation
- Maintain timing alignment between translations
- Support for different Japanese speech patterns

### 4. Speech Synthesis
- Generate natural-sounding Japanese TTS
- Adjustable speech rate for learning
- High-quality audio output
- Proper pronunciation and intonation

### 5. Interactive Interface
- Clean, intuitive Streamlit UI
- Synchronized transcript and audio playback
- Click-to-translate functionality
- Progress tracking and bookmarking

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (Streamlit)
- Responsive design
- Audio player controls
- Transcript display with highlighting
- Translation display panel
- Progress indicators
- Error handling and user feedback

### Backend
- Efficient audio processing pipeline
- Robust error handling
- Caching mechanism for processed content
- API integration for AI services

### AI Components
- Speech-to-Text (STT) service integration
- Translation service integration
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) service integration
- Quality assurance for AI outputs

## User Flow
1. User enters content URL
2. System validates and downloads content
3. Audio processing and transcription begins
4. Translation is generated
5. TTS audio is created
6. User can interact with content:
   - Play/pause audio
   - View transcripts
   - Request translations
   - Adjust playback speed

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple sources (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, etc.)
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Vocabulary list generation
- Difficulty level assessment
- Interactive quizzes
- Mobile optimization

## Success Metrics
- Transcription accuracy rate
- Translation accuracy rate
- TTS quality assessment
- User engagement metrics
- Processing time metrics
- Error rate monitoring

## Development Phases
