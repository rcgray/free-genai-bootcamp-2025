# Japanese Language Learning Visual Novel - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Japanese Language Learning Visual Novel is a web-based game built in Python that operates similar to a Renpy visual novel engine. The game is designed for English-speaking players who want to learn Japanese through an immersive gameplay experience.
