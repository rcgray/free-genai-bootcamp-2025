[Longer Context]
We are at the root of a monoproject repository, and we are preparing it for delivery. The work is complete, but we now need to organize our README files throughout the monorepo to make it easier for potential users to understand our project. This is also a deliverable for a project that will be graded as part of a course, so we will want to ensure that the README files make this grading process as easy as possible for the graders.

Let's take an inventory of the README files in the monorepo:

- `README.md` (@README.md)
- Pre-week 1
  - `genai-architecting/README.md` (@genai-architecting/README.md)
  - `sentence-constructor/README.md` (@sentence-constructor/README.md)
- Week 1
  - `lang-portal/README.md` (@lang-portal/README.md)
  - `lang-portal/frontend-react/README.md` (@lang-portal/frontend-react/README.md)
- Week 2
  - `listening-comp/README.md` (@listening-comp/README.md)
  - `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/README.md` (NYI)
- Week 3
  - `opea-comps/README.md` (@opea-comps/README.md)
  - `opea-comps/backend/README.md` (@opea-comps/backend/README.md)
- Weeks 4 & 5
  - `visual-novel/README.md` (@visual-novel/README.md)
  - `visual-novel/server/README.md` (@visual-novel/server/README.md)
  - `visual-novel/phaser_game/src/utils/README.md` (@visual-novel/phaser_game/src/utils/README.md)

See the `./README.md` file for a summary of the projects within the monorepo and the course work completed. Our current task will be to finalize all of these files to ensure that they are complete and accurate.

For our first step: One README file is missing (NYI): `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/README.md` - which we should add since it became a pretty significant item of work.  Let's add it, highlighting its key purpose as a sample game for our system in which games can be independently developed, using our template and libraries, and then imported into our lang-portal app to share in the learning functionality (word database, groups, etc.) offered by the platform.

You have access to the project's spec documents:

- `lang-portal/docs/Game-Kanji-Snake.md` (@Game-Kanji-Snake.md)
  - This is the specification for the Kanji Snake game.
- `lang-portal/docs/Games-Feature-Spec.md` (@Games-Feature-Spec.md)
  - This is the specification for the functionality added to the Lang Portal that allows for the integration of new games.
- `lang-portal/docs/Games-Harness-Spec.md` (@Game-Harness-Spec.md)
  - This is a how-to guide for developers who want to integrate their games into the Lang Portal.

You also have access to screenshots from the Kanji Snake game in the `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/dev/` directory (@dir).

Finally, you have access to the Kanji Snake game code in the `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/` directory, where you can look through source files such as `src/scenes/MainScene.ts` (@MainScene.ts) to see the implementation of the game to get a sense of controls and user instructions.

Please create a new README file `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/README.md` for the Kanji Snake game, highlighting its key purpose as a sample game for our system in which games can be independently developed, using our template and libraries, and then imported into our lang-portal app to share in the learning functionality (word database, groups, etc.) offered by the platform. At the moment, this is your only task - to write the `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/README.md` file.

---

Great, now let's turn our attention to the other README files in the monorepo. We can skip the root README file for now (we will address that at the end), and we can skip the Pre-week 1 README files as well. Let's start with the Week 1 README files.  We are looking for the following:

- Consistency in the formatting of the README files.
- Copy-editing for correctness and clarity.
- Ensure that the files explain the purpose of the project, the technologies used, and the development process.
- If a file has a screenshot (which you can see in the root project README file, or in the `dev/` directory of the project), please include it in the README file.
- Ensure that the files explain how an individual can run the project, either in development or production mode.

---

Great, and finally, let's take a look at our root README file. The formatting is a little different on this one since it is also a homework submission for a workshop. Details regarding projects and how to run them are provided in the individual project README files. We are looking for the following:

- Copy-editing for correctness and clarity. It's ok if the file is a little verbose, because we want to be thorough. It is also appropriate for it to be written as prose instead of simply as brief lists.
- Ensure that the links to other files (sub-project README files, images, etc.) are correct.

Please make your suggested edits to the root README file, and then echo back a summary of the changes you made.

---

We have been given our final submission form. I am gathering the instructions, which are provided on a webform and a YouTub video. To help gather these instructions, I will need to download the transcript of the video. I have a script @youtube_transcript_dl.py that will help me do this.

The script is not working at the moment. Running it with the command:
`pip install youtube-transcript-api`
(no errors, then I run):
`python youtube_transcript_dl.py https://youtu.be/8jmVBCp2kK4`
or
`python youtube_transcript_dl.py https://youtu.be/8jmVBCp2kK4 -o final_submission_transcript.txt`

Neither has any visible output, either to console or to any file. How could we go about debugging this?

---

Please take the @final_submission_transcript.txt transcript of the video and clean it up - remove the timestamps and blend the speaking together into regular paragraphs such that it can be better consumed as text.  Do not edit in-place - Instead, write the "cleaned up" version of the transcript in the bottom section of the @Submission-Task.md file

---

In the Submission Form section of the @Submission-Task.md file, please observe the fields marked with <TBD>. Read through the Video Transcript section (which includes detailed instructions) on these sections, and add helpful instructions and guidance to the "Notes From Video" section of the form for each of these fields. Do not worry about the "Answer" sections yet, we will get to them later.

---

Now let's populate the "Answer" sections of the @Submission-Task.md file still marked with <TBD>. Note that some of the Answer fields are set to precise values and not marked with <TBD>, and these should not be changed.

For each of the <TBD> fields, please create a thoughtful answer in list format that addresses the question posed in the field. Take the insight gained from the Notes From Video section for each question to help you craft your answer for that question. The final answer we submit will be brief, but for this step be as thorough as you can, so we can then trim down and identify the key points. Be comprehensive in this step.

To help craft thoughtful answers, please review the @README.md file that we have created to serve as a summary of the project. Please also review the @Past-Submissions.md file to see all submissions from previous weeks.

If needed, you can reference the README.md files for each of the weekly sub-projects to help you craft your answers. They are as follows (as referenced in the @README.md file):

- Pre-week 1
  - `genai-architecting/README.md` (@genai-architecting/README.md)
  - `sentence-constructor/README.md` (@sentence-constructor/README.md)
- Week 1
  - `lang-portal/README.md` (@lang-portal/README.md)
  - `lang-portal/frontend-react/README.md` (@lang-portal/frontend-react/README.md)
- Week 2
  - `listening-comp/README.md` (@listening-comp/README.md)
  - `lang-portal/games/kanji-snake/README.md` (NYI)
- Week 3
  - `opea-comps/README.md` (@opea-comps/README.md)
  - `opea-comps/backend/README.md` (@opea-comps/backend/README.md)
- Weeks 4 & 5
  - `visual-novel/README.md` (@visual-novel/README.md)
  - `visual-novel/server/README.md` (@visual-novel/server/README.md)
  - `visual-novel/phaser_game/src/utils/README.md` (@visual-novel/phaser_game/src/utils/README.md)

Your ONLY EDITS for this task should be to the Submission-Task.md file. You should not edit any other files in the project.
---

Great work, and now let's take a look at the prompt history for this project, which is scattered among many "Prompts*.md" files throughout the project. My system has evolved over the course of the work, but these are a record of my communication with you, the Agent, and are a valuable resource for understanding the development process.

As a first step in examining the prompt history, let's create a new directory in the project called `visual-novel/docs/submission/prompts` and create a copy of each of the "Prompts*.md" files in this directory. Have the name of each copied file reflect the subproject it is associated with.

For now, merely copy the files, do not edit them in any way, and do not edit any other files in the project.

---

In the prompts directory `visual-novel/docs/submission/prompts`, we have four prompt files that contain the full prompt history for this project. This consists of four files, one for each of the sub-projects in the project. They are also ordered to show the progression of my prompt engineering skills over the course of the project. I want to start working on a new file `visual-novel/docs/submission/Prompt-Lessons.md` that discuss key lessons that I demonstrated learning over the course of the project.

A couple of things that come to mind:
- Learning how to communicate effectively with the Agent, including how to provide clear and concise instructions, how to provide feedback on the Agent's work, and how to provide context for the Agent's work.
- The planning, documenting, implementing loop: directing the Agent first to answer plans regarding a feature design and document them in a spec file, then directing the Agent to implement the feature, and then directing the Agent to document the implementation.
- The use of Action Plans to guide the overall development process, with integrated "checkpoints" that allowed us to break down the project into more manageable chunks that could be manually verified by the User before proceeding.
- The use of Rules files (`.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) to direct the Agent, avoid pitfalls, and customize its behavior in general, at the project level, the toolchain level, and the specific machine level (e.g., MacOS development vs. Windows).
- Identifying common Agent mistakes and developing patterns for avoiding them.
  - Difficulty navigating directories
  - Difficulty applying project environment context
- How a thorough prompt pre-written in a dedicated Prompt History file can be more effective than simply writing in the prompt box ad-hoc. This not only provides a more effective use of the Agent, but it has a beneficial side-effect of creating a running history of the project that can be examined for insights and lessons.
- How to effectively debug issues with an Agent, beyond simply saying "it doesn't work", by setting up marked debug messages in the prompt that can be used to trace the Agent's thought process and identify where it is going wrong.
- Knowing when to use a non-reasoning agent vs. a reasoning agent, and how to effectively use the capabilities of each.
- Learning to model Agent work at an appropriate level to request it to "one shot" its implementation. Starting at too high a level of work can lead to failure, but working too low is no different than writing code manually.
- Limitations of the Agent, and knowing when I am asking something is is not capable of achieving.

Please create a new file called `Prompt-Lessons.md` that we will begin building out as a deliverable for this final submission. The only edits you should make are to create this specific file and to add the content above.

---

Sorry, I was a little too specific. I would like for you to include the points (now in the file), but not necessarily copy them verbatim. Instead, please use them as a guide to help you write a new file that we will begin building out as a deliverable for this final submission. This is a presentation in markdown, so I will be looking to you to assist in creating a structure that facilitates this presentation.

Next, I would like for you to read through the history of the prompts in the four files in `visual-novel/docs/submission/prompts` directory (@prompts) and add a section to our Prompt-Lessons.md file that provides an overview/summary of the journey I took with you over the course of the project.

---

With your knowledge of the four prompt histories, add a new section to the bottom of the @Prompt-Lessons.md file (Analysis of Prompt History) that explains in more detail how my prompting evolved from the start to the end, which was over a period of a few months. What is your interpretation of the evolution of my prompting?

---

This is great - keeping the same structure, can you go more deeply into it?  More details and insight?

---

Let's take a look at our rules files in the same way we've examined the evolution of the prompts.  I'll save you the lookup and give you these files:

- `lang-portal/.cursorrules`
- `listening-comp/.cursorrules`
- `opea-comps/.cursorrules`
- `visual-novel/.cursorrules`

However, during development of the visual-novel project, I adopted a more sophisticated approach to rules files, taking on their new mdc system. Therefore, this project also has a few others:

- `visual-novel/.cursor/rules/general.mdc`
- `visual-novel/.cursor/rules/project.mdc`
- `visual-novel/.cursor/rules/python.mdc`

Please copy all of the files listed above to the `visual-novel/docs/submission/rules` directory (@rules) in such a way that their filenames reflect the project they are associated with. Don't worry about editing the Prompt-Lessons.md file yet, there is a little more context that I will need to provide first.
---

I've added a ".txt" suffix to the mdc files, so that they are not processed by Cursor, but the content is still there. Next, I would like for you to read through the history of the rules files in the  `visual-novel/docs/submission/rules` directory (@rules) and add a section to our Prompt-Lessons.md file that provides an overview/summary of the evolution of how rules were applied.

A huge difference took place in the visual-novel project. I used to have the .cursorrules file along with a "Prompt-Header.md" file that I would simply link as context at the start of every new chat. This was hit-or-miss, where the rules in "Prompt-Header.md" were MOSTLY followed but not as strictly as those in .cursorrules. I eventually broke out the rules in this "Prompt-Header.md" file to be subject-specific mdc files, which work more effectively and are loaded on-demand as the task requires.

I ran into an issue where I wanted some rules to apply depending on the machine I was using. For example, my Windows/WSL machine uses `conda` for environment management, while my MacOS machine uses classic python venv. I wanted to make sure that the rules files were applied correctly on each machine, but Cursor does not support that kind of conditional processing.

Therefore, I reserve the special .cursorrules file for machine-specific rules where I can include this in the .gitignore file to ensure that it remains individual to each machine.

So let's add a new section to the @Prompt-Lessons.md file (Rules Evolution) that explains the evolution of how rules were applied, and how I overcame the limitations of Cursor to apply rules more effectively.

---

Another key evolution is that I went from AI-generated rules to handwritten.  almost all of the rules in the first .cursorrules file were the result of me asking the AI to create a rules file for the toolchain we were using.  By the end, the rules are hand-crafted based on the challenges and lessons along the way.

---

From the rules files in aggregate, what do you think are the most common Agent mistakes that I've discovered along the way that would have been the purpose for adding these rules?  Create a new section in the @Prompt-Lessons.md file (Common Agent Mistakes) that summarizes these mistakes and how the rules files help avoid them. Please re-read the file, as it has been updated since you last read it.

---

You touched on something interesting in your analysis when you mentioned that there was a "planning, documenting, implementing, and verifying" loop that we were working through.  Let's come up with a name for this - most obvious is the "Planning, Documenting, Implementing, and Verifying" loop (PDIV)?  Can we make a dedicated section on this and how we developed it as a core workflow concept?

---

I've added a new section to the @Prompt-Lessons.md file called "Learn the Agent's Language" that discusses how knowing the names of the internal commands the Agent uses can help bridge the gap between human language and AI capabilities. Can you expand this in two different ways.

1) Create as comprehensive a list as possible of the internal commands the Agent makes use of regularly.
2) Consider ways that Users can "Learn the Agent's Language" beyond just knowing the names of commands.  That's one example, but I bet there are more.

---

Let's talk about another loop (or "cycle" as you seem to prefer) that has become an essential part of our workflow. It is the "Log, Observe, Refine, Iterate" cycle (LORI).  In general, I ask you to not execute the main command for the project - I usually run it myself in another terminal, and preferably withe a watchdog system.

Then, when an error comes up, I send you the error message in my next prompt. Since we don't really have sophisticated debugging tools (man, whoever makes a competent debugger MCP is going to be rich), we instead resort to dreaded "printf debugging". You speckle the codebase with log statements with a unique prefix identifier that relates to our current issue or feature (e.g., "[KB_INPUT] <message>"). I run it again, give you the log output again, and you gain insight into what is going wrong. Not to mention that the unique identifier prefix makes it easy to pull out the relevant messages among other logs so even I can offer ideas. You can see examples of this in the prompt history file for the visual-novel project, as well as the rules files.

We repeat this process until we have a working solution. Then we can remove the logs, either via memory or by that identifier, and we move forward.  We call this the LORI cycle - Log, Observe, Refine, Iterate... and so far there hasn't been an issue we haven't been able to solve.

Can you create a new section in the @AI-Lessons.md file (we renamed the Prompt-Lessons.md file to AI-Lessons.md) for this workflow that describes this process in more detail?

[Ask]
OK, we've had a great history of working together over the last few months, in which my ability to effectively communicate with you has improved. In a previous chat, we discussed the evolution of my prompting skills (and rules files) over the course of the project. I'm creating a compilation of the lessons I've learned and how my approach has evolved over time.

You've helped me a lot with this. First we examined my prompt history over the last few months (stored in the files in the `visual-novel/docs/submission/prompts` directory), and we also looked at how my rules files evolved over time (stored in the `visual-novel/docs/submission/rules` directory). We've had a productive discussion and ended up with a file that both you and I have written.  This file is the focus of our work now: AI-Lessons.md (@AI-Lessons.md).

When you take a look at AI-Lessons.md, you will see that it is a bit of a jumbled mess, where we've collected all of the lessons we could think of over the course of the project, inferring from the prompt history and rules files as well as my own notes.

The clay is all on the wheel, but we need to shape it into a more coherent form. Read through and give me your thoughts on a high-level structure that we can use to organize the lessons into a more coherent form.

---

I think this looks good. Let's take what we have in this AI-Lessons.md file and create a new file called AI-Lessons-Reorganized.md that takes the content of the first file and shapes it into a more coherent form following your suggestions.

---

[Max: $0.40]
Alright, our new file `AI-Lessons-Reorganized.md` (@AI-Lessons-Reorganized.md) is much better organized, but at the moment we've taken the raw clay and repositioned it on the wheel - we haven't yet shaped it into a beautiful vase.

What we need to do now is to make it flow. It should have a fuller introduction that explains what the reader is about to experience, it should introduce the structure and transition smoothly between sections, and it should have a conclusion that ties everything together. It should clearly state its purpose and then support that purpose through the course of the document.

The raw materials here came from a number of different sources - some of them were just brainstorming notes, some were lists, some where freewriting paragraphs, and some were written by you based on analysis of historical interaction data and your insights about yourself. Though the raw writing has been moved to the proper places in the document and unified under common themes now, it needs to be smoothed out and made consistent. Sure, some of the list content should remain as lists, but some of them should be converted to paragraphs.

The writing style should be persuasive, as if we are convincing the reader that these lessons are important and worth their time. We are championing the use of AI agents in our workflow, and we are sharing our journey with them. It should be instructional, where we are attempting to teach the reader how to effectively use AI agents in their workflow. It should avoid stale business-speak and instead be written in a way that is engaging and interesting to read.

Let's write a new version into a new file called `AI-Lessons-Refined.md` (@AI-Lessons-Refined.md - currently empty) that takes the content of `AI-Lessons-Reorganized.md` and writes it in a more final form.

Here are some objectives to consider while performing the rewrite:

- Make sure the document has a full introduction that explains what the reader is about to experience.
- Make sure the document has a conclusion that ties everything together.
- Make sure that content appropriate for list formatting remains as lists, and content that is better suited for paragraphs is converted to paragraphs.
- Make sure the document has a smooth flow and introduction of the structure and flow between sections so the journey the reader takes makes sense to them.
- Make sure the document has a cohesive style and tone as if written by a single author. This tone should be persuasive, instructional, and engaging. It does not need to be formal, and we want to avoid business-speak.
- Of course, make sure the document is free of errors and typos. (copyediting)

Let's make a beautiful vase.

We have iterated on this file a few times now, and I believe we have ended up with a great final version. Let's add mention of this to the project README file (@README.md).  It is one of the most, if not the most significant deliverable for this project, encapsulating my largest domain of growth and evidence of my greatest success in the workshop.  Be sure to provide a link to the AI-Lessons.md file relative to the root of the project: `visual-novel/docs/submission/AI-Lessons.md`.

Let's also make sure that we integrate it into our final submission form (@Submission-Task.md), since it is a significant part of our workshop efforts.

I am submitted a suite of programs that I built for a class, and the professor is asking that they be "containerized" (using Docker).  I'm not super familiar with Docker, but I have it installed on my Windows 10 computer with Windows Desktop on the Windows side and I have it working with WSL.  All of my projects are built in WSL.  Could you guide me through this process?

---

Our project (this repository) is submitted as a monorepo, where each project exists as a sub-repo. If you are able to access the web, the github repo address is: `https://github.com/rcgray/free-genai-bootcamp-2025`. Otherwise, of course, you can ccess the README.md file for the monorepo right here locally - `README.md` (@README.md).

The following is a list of the sub-projects I would need to containerize.  I could build them all in one container, or I could build them in separate containers (which is probably more appropriate, given the whole point of containerization, but what do you think?).

1. Language Learning Portal - A web application for learning Japanese, with a backend written in FastAPI (Python) and a frontend written in React (TypeScript) and TailwindCSS, managed by Vite and backed by a SQLite server via Alembic. The project It includes automated tests for the backend. The app also includes a game integrated into the frontend called Kanji Snake, written using the Phaser game engine.
- Project Subdirectory: `lang-portal` (@lang-portal)
- README.md: `lang-portal/README.md` (@lang-portal/README.md)
2. Japanese Listening App - A Python application built with Streamlit that allows the upload (from local machine) or download (via URL) Japanese audio and then have it transcribed and translated by a LLM.
- Project Subdirectory: `listening-comp` (@listening-comp)
- README.md: `listening-comp/README.md` (@listening-comp/README.md)
3. OPEA Chat - A chatbot application powered by a local LLM that already runs using Docker containers. Unfortunately I don't know exactly how this works or how to bundle all of the components into a single deliverable.
- Project Subdirectory: `opea-comps` (@opea-comps)
- README.md: `opea-comps/README.md` (@opea-comps/README.md)
4. Visual Novel - A story-driven game for learning Japanese, written in TypeScript using the Phaser game engine. It runs stand-alone in the browser, backed by a Vite development server. The project also includes an LLM Proxy server written in Node.js with Express.js that the game uses to query for LLM-based data.
- Project Subdirectory: `visual-novel` (@visual-novel)
- README.md: `visual-novel/README.md` (@visual-novel/README.md)

For each of these projects, I have a live instance on my development machine in which the application is successfully building and running. Each project has its own conda environment (if that helps for determining the dependencies) and its own individual README.md for setting up the project manually (listed above). I would like to make it as easy as possible for my instructor (who is versed in Docker) to run these applications, and I would even like to include some of the local files that I have in the working instances (the state of my dev databases, downloaded audio files, etc.) to allow the apps to work "right out of the box". However, I don't want to include any files that are not needed to run the apps or those where security might be a concern (e.g., API keys in .env files, etc.).

What does the deliverable for these projects look like? Whatever the deliverables are, I think I would like to have them available in the repo under a new folder, called something like "docker" at the root of the repo.

We don't need to make any changes quite yet, I would like to just get your thoughts on the best way to approach this.

---

This looks good. Let's create a new document under the `visual-novel/docs/submission` directory called `Docker-Deliverables.md` (@Docker-Deliverables.md) that outlines in as much detail as possible the plan for accomplishing the containerization process. Then, we can go through the plan step-by-step and you can help me execute the plan. You have write access, so please create the file. Engage!

---

This looks great. I have the following questions and notes. In addition to answering the question and addressing the notes, please update the document as needed:

- In Step 2: each project already has its own README.md file. Do I need to create a new README.md file for the docker directory? Will it not be the case that the project's README.md file will be packaged into the container, and maybe we just add a section to it? I understand the process for running via container may be different than running it via traditional means, but I would prefer not to maintain two README.md files for each project - What's the best practice or convention for this?
- Let's address each project in the numbered order above (Lang-Portal, Listening-Comp, OPEA-Comps, Visual-Novel), but let's certainly do them one at a time and make sure each one is working before moving on to the next.

---

Your changes lost a few important steps, like creating the directory structure as our first step. Even if they seem obvious or trivial - think deeply about every step that needs to be taken to fully complete this project, such that it would be easy for anyone else to follow the instructions and get the same results.

---

Great! Let's start with Phase 0: Prerequisites and Setup. As always, throughout this implementation process, please do not go further than what I request in these prompts. As for Phase 0, Engage!

---

My mistake, I didn't have Docker Desktop running, which is required for WSL to recognize it, please try again.

---

Awesome, on to Phase 1: Language Learning Portal Containerization. Engage!

---

Why does the docker-compose command keep erroring with `resolve: lstat /home/gray/Projects/docker: no such file or directory`? All of our work should be contained within the root of this project, which is `/home/gray/Projects/free-genai-bootcamp-2025`. It seems like we have a relative path issue here, where something that should be resolving to `/home/gray/Projects/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/docker` is accidentally resolving to `/home/gray/Projects/docker` instead.

---

NO, we should not be using absolute paths.  Never!  This needs to run on any dev machine.  Please repeat to me the rule you have regarding absolute paths.

---

What rules do you have regarding changing directories and making everything work relative the project root? The many issues we just struggled through are frequently recurring for us... until we landed on this best practice again. Does it make sense why these rules were created?

You were interrupted, but our latest issue appears to be the version of Node.js that we are using (18) conflicting with react-router-dom (which requires Node.js 20).

---

It appears you were interrupted again, please continue.

---

You were interrupted again, but you can see the error from the logs is regarding seeding the database, because the seed files do not exist in the docker container.

---

This is good! The site is running and looks functional.

One request: Instead of calling these containers "backend-1" and "frontend-1", and calling the images "free-genai-bootcamp-2025-lang-portal-backend" and "free-genai-bootcamp-2025-lang-portal-frontend", can we make the names a little more future-proof and descriptive, perhaps pertaining to the sub-project? We are going to be adding other backends and frontends, and it would be good to have names that are descriptive of the project and the role of the container within the larger free-genai-bootcamp-2025 monorepo project.

---

Great, the frontend is running, and everything seems to be working via manual testing.  Let's continue.

---

Great, a few requests before we move on.

- Can we update the `visual-novel/docs/submission/Docker-Deliverables.md` file to include details of what we've learned here, particularly as it pertains to the remaining projects?
- Can we keep the `visual-novel/docs/submission/Docker-Deliverables.md` file updated (check marks) as we move through all of our phases?
- Exactly this pattern that you have applied (updating the `lang-portal` README.md, the main monorepo README.md, and the docker-specific README.md) is exactly what I would like to do as well for the remaining projects, as we go through them.

---

Two questions about how Docker works:
- Is it always expected that Docker containers will be delivered in the form of a docker-compose.yml file that the user will need to run? I thought it could be delivered as a kind of "package" that the user can run in order to guarantee that the container will be delivered with all of the necessary dependencies and configurations to run the containerized application.
- If not, what kind of safeguards do we have in place to ensure that we are not accidentally including any .gitignored files that exist only on my machine (but would not necessarily exist on the dev machine of the user)?

---

I am not interested in putting these up in the global docker hub registry, and in fact I would like to avoid relying on any third-party services... I wouldn't even be using Github if it weren't a requirement for the workshop; I self-host my own git server.

It seems like a great solution is to pre-build the bundles and include them in the repo (i.e., somewhere in the `docker` directory). Then, the instructor grading the submission can simply run `docker compose up` and the containers will be started. Is that an odd approach?

---

ok, why don't we build that helper file and add it to our README like you suggested?

---

On to Phase 2: Japanese Listening App Containerization. Engage!

---

Great, looks like we're working! By the way, are you using the .gitignore files of the individual projects to determine how to write the dockerignore files?

---

I noticed we got confused a little bit about the location of the docker-compose.yml file. This also was an issue in Phase 1. I see that we have a docker-compose.yml file in the `lang-portal` directory, and now in the `listening-comp` directory, but we also have a docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project.

We need to be consistent about this - we should either have a single docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project, or we should have a docker-compose.yml files in the individual project directories. (unless the one in the root is calling the project-specific docker-compose.yml files?). And in any case, we need to be sure that our README.md files are informing the user of the correct process for running the containers.  Right now the main repo README.md is saying that to run lang-portal they should run `docker compose up -d` and to run listening-comp they should run `docker compose -f docker/listening-comp/docker-compose.yml up -d`.

And are we consistent in our `/docker/build-and-run.sh` file?

---

What about the docker-compose.yml file in the lang-portal directory?  Have you thought this completely through?

---

The monorepo README.md file has the same command for running the lang-portal and listening-comp containers (`docker compose up -d`). If we are going to have instructions for the specific projects individually, shouldn't we make the instructions project-specific?

---

There should either be a single docker-compose.yml file in the root of the project, or we should have a docker-compose.yml files in the individual project directories.  If listening-comp is launched via `docker compose up -d listening_comp_app`, then the lang-portal should be launched via `docker compose up -d lang_portal_app`. IF WE ARE USING A SINGLE DOCKER-COMPOSE.YML FILE, THEN WE NEED TO BE CONSISTENT ABOUT IT.

---

Thank you, I think we finally got there. Please add what we've learned from this to the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file, so we can remain consistent through the remaining two projects we need to containerize.

---

Reviewing the listening-comp README, it appears that it is still using a general `docker compose up -d` command.

---

OK great, on to Phase 3: OPEA Chat Containerization. Please re-read the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file (@Docker-Deliverables.md) if you need to be refreshed on the plan and our best practices. Engage!

---

In the opea_comps_tgi entry in docker-compose.yml, it appears that the model file is hard-coded. Shouldn't this be pulled from somewhere, especially since (in the README.md) it says that they should set the MODEL_FILE environment variable?

Also, in the past two projects, you actually tested the solution after you wrote it, here you didn't.

---

I would like to remove any explicit mention of "Meta-Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q6_K_L.gguf" in any of the files we've written. For instance, if a MODEL_FILE is not specified, or no model is downloaded, the app should not run.  It shouldn't require the specific filename of the model I chose and downloaded on my machine.

Why in model-setup.sh did you just hallucinate the URLs for the model files out of nowhere?  Don't do things like that - if you need URLs, you can ask for them.

---

OK, the monorepo README.md has some steps for the OPEA Chat project "Running with Docker". Let's run through them together to make sure everything is working.

---

You were interrupted, please continue

---

You were interrupted... again. Please continue

---

It works! Great job.  I think we still have a few documentation items to address, please review the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file (@Docker-Deliverables.md) and make sure we have covered all of the bases.

---

Did you forget about checking off items in the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file?

---

# New chat (Agent, claude-3.7-sonnet, thinking)

I have submitted a suite of programs that I built for a class, and the professor is asking that they be "containerized" (using Docker).  I'm not super familiar with Docker, but I have it installed on my Windows 10 computer with Windows Desktop on the Windows side and I have it working with WSL.  All of my projects are built in WSL.

Our project (this repository) is submitted as a monorepo, where each project exists as a sub-repo. If you are able to access the web, the github repo address is: `https://github.com/rcgray/free-genai-bootcamp-2025`. Otherwise, of course, you can ccess the README.md file for the monorepo right here locally - `README.md` (@README.md).

The following is a list of the sub-projects I would need to containerize:

1. (Completed) Language Learning Portal - A web application for learning Japanese, with a backend written in FastAPI (Python) and a frontend written in React (TypeScript) and TailwindCSS, managed by Vite and backed by a SQLite server via Alembic. The project It includes automated tests for the backend. The app also includes a game integrated into the frontend called Kanji Snake, written using the Phaser game engine.
- Project Subdirectory: `lang-portal` (@lang-portal)
- README.md: `lang-portal/README.md` (@lang-portal/README.md)
2. (Completed) Japanese Listening App - A Python application built with Streamlit that allows the upload (from local machine) or download (via URL) Japanese audio and then have it transcribed and translated by a LLM.
- Project Subdirectory: `listening-comp` (@listening-comp)
- README.md: `listening-comp/README.md` (@listening-comp/README.md)
3. (Completed) OPEA Chat - A chatbot application powered by a local LLM that already runs using Docker containers. Unfortunately I don't know exactly how this works or how to bundle all of the components into a single deliverable.
- Project Subdirectory: `opea-comps` (@opea-comps)
- README.md: `opea-comps/README.md` (@opea-comps/README.md)
4. (Not Started) Visual Novel - A story-driven game for learning Japanese, written in TypeScript using the Phaser game engine. It runs stand-alone in the browser, backed by a Vite development server. The project also includes an LLM Proxy server written in Node.js with Express.js that the game uses to query for LLM-based data.
- Project Subdirectory: `visual-novel` (@visual-novel)
- README.md: `visual-novel/README.md` (@visual-novel/README.md)

For each of these projects, I have a live instance on my development machine in which the application is successfully building and running. Each project has its own conda environment (if that helps for determining the dependencies) and its own individual README.md for setting up the project manually (listed above). I would like to make it as easy as possible for my instructor (who is versed in Docker) to run these applications, and I would even like to include some of the local files that I have in the working instances (the state of my dev databases, downloaded audio files, etc.) to allow the apps to work "right out of the box". However, I don't want to include any files that are not needed to run the apps or those where security might be a concern (e.g., API keys in .env files, etc.).

Important: We have a file `visual-novel/docs/submission/Docker-Deliverables.md` (@Docker-Deliverables.md) that outlines in as much detail as possible the plan for accomplishing the containerization process. Please review this document carefully, because it contains not only the steps we need to take but also our best practices we have learned along the way and pitfalls to avoid.

We have successfully completed Phases 0-3 of the plan outlined in the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file, and now we are ready to start Phase 4: Visual Novel Containerization. Engage!

You were interrupted, please continue.

---

You were immediately interrupted again. Please continue.

---

You have not followed all of the instructions in the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file. Please review the file and make sure you have followed all of the steps. There is documentation strategy, checking completed items, etc. I should not have to remind you of this, the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file is the most important document in this project. I noted it as "Important:" in the beginning of this conversation. Please do not forget it again.

---

We don't need a COMPLETION-STATUS.md file, you are supposed to update the `visual-novel/docs/submission/Docker-Deliverables.md` file so it is all in one place.  After you delete this new file and move it to its proper place, please step through testing our new container system for the visual novel to make sure everything works properly.  It is not your fault it keeps getting interrupted, push through the issues and continue.

---

You were interrupted again, but we've made substantial progress. Please continue.

---

Running the visual novel docker containers results in both the visual-novel-server and visual-novel-game containers running, but the visual-novel-game container is not serving the game. It just shows a plain webpage that says "Visual Novel Game Container. This is a simplified test container for the Visual Novel game. The full game build will be implemented here."

---

The game now plays, but it is missing ALL ASSETS (there are no images, only text). Are you not including the assets in the container?  Or perhaps this can be simplified - have you looked at the `visual-novel/phaser_game/package.json` file? There is an npm script that builds the game (via vite build), so perhaps we should just be building the game and packaging the resulting build?  What do you think is best here?

---

I realized that we built our docker container for visual-novel-game on a very old build of the game. I've now updated the game to the latest version and rebuilt it, but `docker compose up -d visual_novel_game visual_novel_server` still runs the old version. How do I "rebuild" the container? Also, since a new user with a new repository won't have the game built when they first git clone, how do I have the build process for the container run the ` npm --prefix phaser_game run build` command from the visual-novel/phaser_game directory?

---

I see, now when a new user runs `docker compose up -d visual_novel_game visual_novel_server`, since they've never run `docker compose build visual_novel_game visual_novel_server` before (and we don't appear to instruct them to), is that something that happens automatically as a result of the call to `docker compose` when no build is present?

---

Why when I run `docker compose up -d visual_novel_game visual_novel_server` do I get the following error:

```
(🐍vn) @:~/Projects/free-genai-bootcamp-2025 (🧪main)$ docker compose up -d visual_novel_game visual_novel_server
WARN[0003] Found orphan containers ([listening-comp]) for this project. If you removed or renamed this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag to clean it up.
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container visual-novel-game    Started                                                                                                                                 3.6s
 ✔ Container visual-novel-server  Started
 ```

 it's good that the containers are running, but why is it saying that listening-comp is an orphan container? This could have been from a renaming, where (for some reason I'm not sure of), you renamed listening-comp to listening-comp-app. but it appears there is something we didn't clean up fully.

---

ok, the game is running!  Everything looks great, and with that I think our visual-novel containerization is complete.  Please update the `Docker-Deliverables.md` file (and all other relevant README.md files specified in our documentation strategy) to reflect the completion of this phase, and then let's move on to the next phase.

---

The README.md file for the monoproject says:

```
Currently implemented containers:
- Language Learning Portal (frontend and backend)
- Japanese Listening Comprehension App
- OPEA Chat (llama.cpp TGI, backend service, and Streamlit frontend)

As more project phases are completed, the script will be updated to include those containers as well.
```

You have not thought about this very carefully. What other things might you have missed?

---

The README.md file for the monorepo is missing a "#### Running with Docker" section (like all the others). Even if the "## Using Docker to Run All Applications" comes after it, we should still be consistent across apps

---

Have we double-checked our `./docker/build-and-run.sh` file?
