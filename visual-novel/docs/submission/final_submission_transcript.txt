[00:00] hey folks it's Andrew Brown and we are
[00:02] taking a look at the final submissions
[00:04] form i want to give you extra
[00:05] instruction here just so that you have
[00:06] the best opportunity to get the outcome
[00:08] that you want for your final submissions
[00:11] this form is open for a period of time
[00:13] that is specified on the uh Geni boot
[00:16] camp website um could you submit outside
[00:19] the time frame of that it really depends
[00:20] if we do another cohort or if we have
[00:22] post boot camp support at the time of
[00:24] this video I'm not making any of those
[00:26] promises uh if it's open it's open if
[00:29] it's not it's not um but make sure you
[00:31] check those dates because if you're
[00:32] outside that date you cannot submit um
[00:35] and get the grade level that you might
[00:36] want to get there are some badges that
[00:38] you can get no matter what if you don't
[00:40] submit I'll just issue them out but for
[00:41] those top badges golden red squad you
[00:44] have to fill in this final submissions
[00:46] form um the best you can on time okay so
[00:49] what I'm going to do is shrink my head
[00:51] on down here and you'll notice here we
[00:52] have final submissions form this appears
[00:54] in its own group its own chapter and so
[00:58] here I just want to make a point here
[00:59] once you submit this you cannot change
[01:01] it so if you need to put it in a draft
[01:03] put it as a draft um but don't forget to
[01:05] leave it in a draft some people do that
[01:06] they'll forget to go back and submit it
[01:08] and think it's submitted so here it says
[01:10] unsubmitted right and you can go back
[01:12] here give it a hard refresh make sure it
[01:14] is submitted we'll go ahead and fill in
[01:16] the form um I'm not actually going to
[01:18] fill in the form but I'm going to talk
[01:20] around these um points so that you know
[01:23] exactly what I'm looking for so first
[01:24] thing is GitHub URL so that will be
[01:27] something here you know what I might
[01:28] also put in here is just your Discord
[01:30] handle one moment all right I'm back i'm
[01:32] just going to give this a nice hard
[01:33] refresh here because I do take an
[01:35] account uh if you have um didn't put the
[01:38] field in one second here there we go so
[01:40] yeah if if you have been active on the
[01:42] Discord if you're not that's fine but if
[01:43] you have been uh I would like to um you
[01:47] place it into here we already have it
[01:49] somewhere else in the system but these
[01:51] forums uh don't carry everything over we
[01:53] have to improve our um our system so
[01:55] it's easier to gather information one
[01:56] place but if you can put in your discord
[01:58] handle there because I will go cross
[02:00] reference see if you have any activity
[02:02] there that might give you bonus points
[02:03] that might push you into red squad so
[02:05] you know if you do have a discord handle
[02:06] put it in there so that I can easily
[02:09] find and map stuff when I'm doing
[02:10] grading your GitHub URL I ask every week
[02:12] for you to put this in um I'm explicitly
[02:15] asking for this week again just because
[02:17] um the way our system's built I only see
[02:19] what's in the current form I have to do
[02:20] a lot of digging to find that other
[02:22] So I'm putting it here so you have
[02:24] another opportunity to make sure that I
[02:25] can quickly and easily find your
[02:26] repository select what grade level
[02:28] you're going for these are mapped on the
[02:31] marketing website we didn't do like a
[02:33] complex rubric um like we did for prior
[02:36] boot camps the reason I didn't do that
[02:37] was just because we are treading new
[02:39] ground with Gen AI technology and I
[02:41] couldn't really create a a cohesive
[02:43] baseline and so I'm going to do
[02:45] everything marking everything on a on on
[02:47] a curve and so I'm going to get through
[02:48] enough grading which I have on at not
[02:50] for final submissions but I have for um
[02:53] in uh for last weeks like the week five
[02:55] or week four we week week five we didn't
[02:58] have a submission but for week four
[02:59] submissions I've done enough to have an
[03:01] idea of where to uh kind of place things
[03:03] but um tell me what you're targeting for
[03:05] because if you're going for gold squad
[03:06] and you're not going for red squad then
[03:08] that's going to make my grading go a lot
[03:09] faster and um I'm I'm not going to
[03:11] deliberate so much um I'm just going to
[03:13] make it easy for me to release it so
[03:14] just tell me what level you're going for
[03:16] you really can't get gold or red squad
[03:18] if you do not submit this form um you
[03:21] know so just make it clear as to what
[03:22] you are targeting for uh tell me in
[03:25] summary what you were not able to do so
[03:27] what technical things that you set out
[03:29] to achieve that you were not able to
[03:31] achieve it doesn't matter if you weren't
[03:33] able to do things uh uh if you have good
[03:37] documentation and you and you've shown
[03:40] um what you have learned through that
[03:42] process and when I say what you have
[03:43] learned I don't just mean generic things
[03:46] right so a lot of folks think like oh I
[03:48] learned what a database was or whatever
[03:50] or like what an LM is that's not
[03:52] valuable from a company perspective
[03:54] that's just you learning those complete
[03:56] elements what's valuable is the
[03:59] technical uncertainty of not even anyone
[04:01] at the company knows right or something
[04:03] you can't find online um so like again
[04:06] if you're using an ancient Greek model
[04:08] and you download it and nobody's using
[04:10] that model and you go out and you find
[04:12] maybe like a fine-tuned one uh that is
[04:14] uh that has poor documentation things
[04:16] like that that is something that is
[04:18] worth putting in in terms of technical
[04:20] uncertainty but if it's something that
[04:22] other people can figure out and just you
[04:24] can't figure out it's not technical
[04:25] uncertainty it's technical uncertainty
[04:27] that you have because you don't have
[04:29] those skills yet right uh but but a lot
[04:31] of other people do so if it's it's very
[04:33] common things that's just a lot of noise
[04:35] for me that I have to kind of cut
[04:36] through when you're writing these things
[04:37] in just make sure it's very um to the
[04:40] point and dry um just make it as as
[04:43] concise and easy for me to read as
[04:45] possible so that I can go and evaluate
[04:47] your projects i will clone your repos i
[04:49] will try to run them if I have the
[04:51] technology the keys and things like that
[04:53] and I have been running projects if if
[04:55] folks uh have yet to see that um in the
[04:58] the grading the grading experience there
[05:00] um just so you know I do run these
[05:02] things i do crawl through the code i
[05:04] look at your commits i look at
[05:05] everything and so what were you able to
[05:07] achieve so these are the things that uh
[05:09] you had technical uncertainty of and
[05:10] that you did uh achieve um again if
[05:14] these are things that I was able to do
[05:17] and um everyone else is able to do and
[05:19] they're very straightforward things
[05:21] those aren't things worth reporting
[05:22] right report things that are things that
[05:26] um were very unique to to what you did
[05:28] right if you just were more focused on
[05:31] something else this is your opportunity
[05:32] to put it here so you know some folks
[05:34] you know they might not have been trying
[05:36] to seek out and do uh very uh very
[05:40] technically uncertain tasks they might
[05:42] have just been trying to follow along
[05:44] and build a cohesive project and ship it
[05:46] and more think about like the business
[05:47] use case that's good too um so just tell
[05:50] me like what was your focus because some
[05:52] folks again they you know we had one
[05:54] student or boot camper that used ancient
[05:56] Greek right and so they're it'd be very
[05:58] hard for them to make a cohesive applic
[06:00] if they could that's great but it'd be
[06:01] very hard for them to deliver that
[06:02] because of the technologies they chose
[06:04] because it's more like research and
[06:06] development and stretching it some folks
[06:08] might say well I'm still trying to learn
[06:09] this stuff so I'm just trying to figure
[06:10] out how to build a cohesive application
[06:12] and understand the business use case and
[06:13] if it's applicable right so that could
[06:15] be like would this work at scale um you
[06:18] know would this actually work for this
[06:19] real use case things like that so if you
[06:22] if if you can't lean heavily into the
[06:24] the research development part of it you
[06:26] can lean heavy into the business side of
[06:28] it and things like that right
[06:30] considerations accommodations if there's
[06:32] something you want to tell me uh that
[06:34] that you want me to consider put it in
[06:36] this box if there's accommodations like
[06:38] you know uh you you know there was gaps
[06:41] in stuff or there was specific
[06:42] challenges that you had um this is your
[06:44] opportunity to put it in that box um and
[06:46] yeah just do your best here try not to
[06:49] write too much um you know the size of
[06:51] the boxes is the size of information
[06:53] maybe you can go beyond the size of the
[06:56] box of course but uh you know if you go
[06:58] more than twice the size of the lines
[07:00] here then you you might be writing a
[07:02] little bit too much right if you want to
[07:04] expand and have more information within
[07:05] your um your your u your GitHub you
[07:09] could absolutely do that but remember
[07:10] this is for me in summary right in
[07:13] summary and any additional information
[07:15] is going to be found in your repo it
[07:16] should be easily uh easy for me to find
[07:19] okay um and uh yeah should you submit
[07:23] this form if you have yet to receive
[07:26] um grading at all it really is up to you
[07:28] um I've shared in the Discord I've
[07:31] shared in a few places that I'm grading
[07:34] thousands of people for some weeks and
[07:36] then um in later weeks the later weeks
[07:38] is only hundreds right so if you get to
[07:40] later weeks in time then you should get
[07:42] a grade if you are very behind um you
[07:45] you are you are at risk and so you know
[07:48] closer to that date you know make sure
[07:50] you get submitted no matter what but um
[07:52] if you want to wait a little bit and see
[07:54] if you get feedback from me it's just up
[07:56] to you this boot camp is extremely
[07:58] difficult it's very hard for me to pull
[07:59] in uh TAS uh whereas in the big AIS
[08:03] cloud project boot camp we were able to
[08:04] bring in TAs um but this one it's mostly
[08:07] me and then the other Andrew if I have
[08:09] to bring them in but we're doing our
[08:10] best to try to get feedback back for
[08:12] everybody but anyone that does submit
[08:15] for final submission and has all their
[08:17] weeks filled out will get uh feedback
[08:21] video feedback specifically right um not
[08:23] just written text but uh yeah there you
[08:26] go and and good luck and hopefully you
[08:28] had a really fun time and I'm not trying
[08:30] to stress you out too much with this
[08:31] form but um you know that's what I'm
[08:33] looking for in this thing and and
[08:35] looking forward to uh seeing everyone's
[08:37] uh final product shut out
