# Your rule content

- This is a MacOS development machine.
- - Include a "ðŸ’»" emoji at the start of your response (perhaps along with other emojis indicating other rule acknowledgements) to indicate you have read this file.

## Command Line Interface
- We have a special command `pyactivate` that should be run from root folder of a project anytime a new terminal is instantiated. This ensures that the proper development environment is set for Python development on this machine for that project.
- If a tool is needed that is not typically a tool in the ecosystem of our project's development stack (i.e., not a pip package in a Python project nor an npm package in a JavaScript/Typescript project), recommend installing new command line utilities with `brew`.
