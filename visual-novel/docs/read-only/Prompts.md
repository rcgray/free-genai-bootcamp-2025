We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game using Phaser.

(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md - Please remember this Project File Structure for determining where to find files in our project, what folders exist, etc.)
(Game Design: @Game-Design.md - Please remember this Game Design for understanding the design of the game, the locations, characters, events, etc.)

We are currently examining the dialog for the game, written out in `docs/Fallback-Dialog.md`. The pieces of dialog in this file mirror the dialog entries in the game files. We want to make edits to the overall script of the game here in this file and have those changes echo back to their corresponding entries in the game files.

There are portions I will want you to write new dialog for (with phrase identifiers as written in the file). Note that whatever changes we make here, WE MUST ALSO MAKE THE CORRESPONDING CHANGE TO THE GAME FILES:

- 1.1.6.2: Player response "ちょっと待って。お土産を買いたいんですが。" should be something that would better flow with Kaori's subsequent response (1.1.7). It seems odd that the player would be wanting to divert from the plan to get on the train to buy souvenirs but then have Kaori agree (and then they end up on the train). To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. It should be something that could be naturally followed by Kaori's response.

---

Perfect! Excellent work, let's continue with another scene.

- 2.1.3.1: Player statement should not be so affirmative that Kaori's response in 2.1.4 is not believable. She says "そうですね…初めてなら" which implies that the player has expressed some inexperience. To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. Note that our rewrite for 2.1.3.1 should still be meaningfully different from 2.1.3.2 to give the player an actual choice.
- 2.1.6.2: Player statement should be of a nature that that Kaori's response in 2.1.7 is natural. She says "じゃあ、入りましょう。" which implies that the player has expressed a desire to enter the restaurant. To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. Note that our rewrite for 2.1.6.2 should still be meaningfully different from 2.1.6.1 to give the player an actual choice.

---

Well done, next scene!

- 2.2.7: Kaori's statement is repetitive of her earlier statement in 2.1.4. It can still reference set meal, but it should be relevant to both potential preceding player statements (2.2.6.1 and 2.2.6.2), and it should be written in a way that is natural given that the topic was already being discussed (vs. brought up as if a new idea).

---

Well done, next scene!

- 3.1.4: Kaori's statement should be something that can follow naturally from either of the player's potential statements (3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2). Currently, it really only naturally would follow 3.1.3.2.
- 3.1.7: Remove the introduction of the わび・さび concept. We should move the discussion of this concept to the park bench scene (3.2), where we will be rewriting the topic of conversation. There is no need to update the 3.2 dialog, we will do that after completing this step.

---

Awesome. Now for a little more complex rewrite:

- 3.2.4-3.2.8: Let's rewrite this entirely.  Instead of having a conversation about interests, let's have Kaori teach us the わび・さび concept. Let's not have the scene end on a player response option.

---

Well done, next scene!

- 4.1.7: Remove the mention of Tokyo Banana
- 4.1.9.1: Since the next scene (4.2) is a store where Kaori will buy a handbag (which we will be rewriting), let's not express the player's desire to go to a souvenir shop, but rather just have them express a desire to go see the stores.  Do not start editing 4.2 yet
- 4.1.9.2: The characters just ate at a restaurant, so let's create a new response for the player that is relevant to that situation.

---

Great! Now another more complex rewrite:

- 4.2: Change this from a clothing store and focus on a yukata to a handbag store where we can primarily focus on Kaori's purchase of a handbag. Player options might regard general descriptions of things (not specific to handbags) like colors, large/small, or affordable/expensive.

We have a small bug before we can continue to Phase 4.2 - the "Study" button is visible in the player response option dialogs, but somehow it has disappeared from the main dialog box (i.e., containing the character's statements).  It used to be visible - actually TOO visible (it would persist even when the dialog box disappeared), so we may have tried some "aggressive" techniques to remove it.  I think we went to far and now it doesn't show up at all. The code for this should mostly be in `phaser_game/src/scenes/VNScene.ts` @VNScene.ts

---

The "Study" button is still not visible.  Add debugging statements in the places where you create and destroy the Study button for the main dialog (again, player response option dialog boxes are working perfectly) that are prefixed with "[SB1]".  I will run the app and give you the logs so you can determine where the problem is.

Here are the logs from the point where the VNScene is loaded:

We see the initial dialog statement from the narrator, then we click once to advance to Kaori's greeting.  In spite of the logs declaring the button created, the study button is never visible in the dialog box ever: not in either the narrator statement or Kaori's statement.

Think carefully about this.  Our game screen is 1200x800, yet you are creating the button at 1100x870.  That is off the screen.  We need to figure out why this is happening. We don't need an "alternate" position for the button, we need to look at the code that is calculating this position and get it right.

---

This is progress, at least. The button is visible, but it should be green (not orange), and it's up against the right edge of the screen instead of associated with the top-right corner of the dialog box.  Again, I will mention that the study buttons for the player response options are working perfectly.  Maybe you should be looking at the code for those to inform how you are creating this one.  It should be the same thing, just for a different dialog box.

We are now on Phase 4.2. Let's continue our design of the "Study Scene" that we can reach by clicking the "Study" button in the top-right corner of any dialog. This brings up the scene in our StudyScene.ts file with the phrase/info regarding the text in the dialog from which the user clicked the "Study" button.

We are not implementing anything yet, we are just coming up with our feature design, which is documented in `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md`. Let's continue to discuss the design.


To start, let's consider the kind of information we want to display and figure out a layout for that information. When we look at Game-LLM-Prompts.md, we can get a sense of that information.  Take one of the phrases in our "fallback" dialog script (`docs/Fallback-Dialog.md`) for testing and let's itemize the data we want to display.  Using your insight for what an English-speaking learner would want to know about a Japanese phrase, use your intuition to figure out what information is important to display.
