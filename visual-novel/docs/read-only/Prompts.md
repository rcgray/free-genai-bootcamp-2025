We are setting up a new project, using some of the files from previous projects as a starting point. Please follow the instructions in `dev/template/Project-Setup.md` (@Project-Setup.md) up to Step 3.3 Dynamic Documentation, where we will then work together to generate the core project specifications files.

---
# git commit
# Run `python scripts/update_docs.py`
---

Perfectly done! Here is our new project file structure: (@Project-File-Structure.md) Now let's work together to generate the core project specifications files. Keep in mind that we are now working from the instructions in the copy of `Project-Setup.md` (@Project-Setup.md) in the root of the project folder that you have copied and edited.

We'll start with the `docs/PRD.md` file, and only the `docs/PRD.md` file. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/PRD.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/PRD.md` file for this project.

This project aims to create a game in Python that runs in the browser and operates similar to a Renpy visual novel. In fact, the closer we can make it to implementing Renpy's visual novel engine, the better. The game will be written in Japanese for English-speaking players that are looking to learn Japanese through gameplay. The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and process study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

The primary goals of this project are:
- (Functional) To create a simple engine for crafting web-based visual novel game experiences.
- (Design) To design a game that provides English-speaking players with a way to learn Japanese through gameplay.
- (Exploration) To explore the potential and limitations of LLMs as a design material for game development.

The game will consist of three scenes:

- Title Scene
- VN (visual novel) Scene
- Study Scene

The player will start on the Title Scene, which may have some options to toggle to customize the game experience (TBD). They will then click a button to start the VN Scene, which is where the majority of the game takes place. There are four UI elements in the VN Scene:

- A background image, such as a landscape or a room.
- Character sprites in front of the background image, showing a vignette of the character's face and body that the player is currently interacting with.
- A chat section in front of the background image and character sprites, where the character dialog is displayed.
- A selection of multiple-choice dialog options (max 3) that the player can click on as their choice of what their character says in the scene to the other characters.

Because this is a game intended for language learning, there will be opportunities in the VN Scene to select language (i.e., a phrase said by a character or the dialog options available to the player) and enter a focused study session for that phrase, which is where the Study Scene comes in. After completing the Study Scene, the player will return to the VN Scene, where the game will continue. These opportunities will be indicated by a button in the VN Scene next to the chat section.

The Study Scene will take the text associated with the portion of the dialog that the player chose to study and present it in a way that allows the player to examine it more closely. For example, with pronunciation (romaji) and English translation. A "Back" button will return the player to the VN Scene.

The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

---

Great! Now we'll move to the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, and only the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/Technical-Spec.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file for this project.

We will write the game using the Phaser game engine. Here is documentation for Phaser, which has been added to Cursor:

- Phaser General Documentation: (@Phaser General Documentation) - https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser
- Phaser API Documentation: (@Phaser API Documentation) - https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/api-documentation

Toolset:
- Python 3.12+
- Phaser (current version is 3.88.2)
- Ruff
- MyPy
- Pytest
- TinyDB (not initially, but intended for later)
- OpenAI

Notes:
- Though we will manually run commands like ruff and mypy, we wil not create any pre-commit hooks.
- This project will not use a database initially. If and when we decide to add one, we will use TinyDB.
- We are intentionally not using RenPy for this project, but rather we are attempting to create a similar experience using Phaser.
- We will interact with an LLM backend via a REST API using the OpenAI standard. This does not necessarily mean that we will use OpenAI, but rather that we will use a standard that is compatible with OpenAI and have the flexibility to change providers later if we wish.

Please be sure to include a section for the documentation links in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file.

---
# if needed:
---

This `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file is a good start, but it is missing a lot of my notes from the previous prompt, such as the definition of the MVP and the featuers we will not be aiming to build initially. Let's take another pass at it and include additional detail regarding our implementation priorities and what we're aiming to build as our foundation. Again, we are working in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, and only the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file.

Also add a note regarding the local models we would prefer to use (they were listed a few prompts ago).  Add a section on documentation web references we've included in Cursor so far so that we have easy reference of it.  

---

That sounds great! Now we will take everything we've created so far (the `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/Technical-Spec.md` files and, at an even higher priority, the notes from my past prompts) and make sure we integrate these notes into our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. This file is the most important of all the files we've created so far, and it is the one that will guide our work from here on out. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/Action-Plan.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/Action-Plan.md` file for this project.

How will we create our MVP, step-by-step? We want to be able to build our application following the steps from top-to-bottom, so ordering of steps is important. In determining this order, consider three factors:

- **MVP Priority**: How can we best enforce our priorities for the features in the construction of this plan? Perhaps our earliest steps should be to get the scenes working with the Phaser engine with static text before we work on more complex features like LLM integration. It is useful to set up CLI scripts that can test initially before we test the UI manually.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that the order of the steps reflects dependencies, where we build dependencies first before ordering other tasks that would depend on them.
- **Implementation Complexity**: Ensure that the steps are as simple as possible, moving into complexity later. It's ok to have an implementation focus "split" across multiple steps, if only part of it is a dependency and the rest is optional or more complex.  

Remember that we are carefully considering multiple sources in constructing this plan:

- The `docs/PRD.md` file
- The `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file
- The notes from my past prompts in this conversation

Let's take a shot at building the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file, and only the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

---

Nice work. Now that we have our Action Plan, please use your intuition regarding the work items to determine when natural stopping points occur, and let us be sure to include [Checkpoint] instructions at these natural stopping points for us to pause and evaluate. Mark these with [Checkpoint] instructions.

---

Great! We have completed section 3.2 of the `Project-Setup.md` file. Update our progress in the `Project-Setup.md` file.

---
# git commit
---

We will skip Section 3.3 of the `Project-Setup.md` file, marking these items as `[~]` (intentionally skipped). We will move on to Section 3.4, where these Tool Files should be naturally created in the course of completing Step 1.1 in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Note that in creating our tools files, if there are any that are not applicable, they should be individually marked as `[~]` (intentionally skipped).

So let's move to implementing Step 1.1 in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file and create our basic project, where many of these steps will naturally check off some boxes in the `Project-Setup.md` file for Step 3.4.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You may have a temptation to go further and actually start implementing aspects of the project, but please do not.  Right now we must follow the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file as it is our guide.  We will update it as we go along, but for now we must follow it as written. We are working on Step 1.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file to create our basic project structure so we can finish out the rest of the steps in the `Project-Setup.md` file.

---
# if needed
---

We were just intending to do Step 1.1 from the @Action-Plan.md Action Plan fileand set up our project structure, though it appears you have gone ahead and implemented some significant portions of the project already. This is not optimal, but we'll move forward with it.  However, in the course of that implementation you made some technical decisions (such as to use Streamlit, which was never specified).  Please review the choices that you made in this implementation and update the @Technical-Spec.md Technical-Spec.md document to include any other assumptions or technologies you've chosen to add to our implementation

---
# edit the pyproject.toml file or package.json file to include my info
---


Beautiful! our final step in the Project-Setup.md file (Step 4: Wrap-Up) is to evaluate the previously copied files for applicability to the new project, adding or removing elements as needed. Now that we've set up our tools and defined our tech stack, we should be able to update our `.gitignore`, `.cursorignore`, `.cursorrules`, `.env.example`, etc. files to better suit our project.

We can then update our `Project-Setup.md` and `Action-Plan.md` files to reflect the changes.

---

# Dev Steps:
- Git commit everything
- Create conda env or uv venv or what is needed
- Install tools & dependencies, `uv sync --extra dev`, etc.
- Set up .env from .env.example
- Move (now completed) Project-Setup.md to the /docs/read-only directory
- Delete the `dev/template` folder (optional)
- Run `scripts/update_docs.py` script again

- Start a new chat, pick up where we left off in the Action Plan

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file (@Project-File-Structure.md). Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We are working within a conda environment called `vn` so please include activating that environment in your commands. Additionally, we are using uv to manage our dependencies, so please include that in your commands.

Our project tools are set up as indicated in `Project-Setup.md`. Now it is time for us to start building the project GRADUALLY via the plan in `docs/Action-Plan.md`.

First, let's make sure that our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file is up to date.  There may be work we've already done that we can use to check off items in the plan.

---

Since our project setup is complete, we have moved the Project-Setup.md file to the `docs/` directory and will not need to reference it again.

It appears we have completed Step 1.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We've now decided to serve our Phaser game using Streamlit (which is not part of the original plan).  We may need to make updates both to our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file and our `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file and possibly the `README.md` file to reflect this change.  I want to make sure that all three of these files are in sync with each other.  If there are any inconsistencies, let's discuss them.

---

Excellent.  Let's move on to Step 1.2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. In general, we will want to implement as much of our project within the Phaser game, not the Streamlit wrapper.  We may add some utilities and UI outside the game to aid development, but the goal for now is to minimize the Streamlit wrapper and intend to implement as much as possible within the Phaser game itself.

---

Good job, and thank you for remembering to limit your actions to only those requested in the prompt's latest, explicit instructions.  Let's move on to Step 1.3 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. A new file `docs/Prompt-Notes.md` has been added to the project to provide some notes to consider with every prompt as we develop our project. Please review it and keep it in mind as we continue to develop our project.

---

Fantastic. The `docs/Prompt-Notes.md` file has been updated as well, so I'm including it again in the prompt.

Before we move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file, let's make sure that we have a solid plan for the scenes that we will be building. The documentation for this is sparse in our `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, so let's take a moment to review the current state of the file and make sure that we flesh out some details. As a reminder:

The primary goals of this project are:
- (Functional) To create a simple engine for crafting web-based visual novel game experiences.
- (Design) To design a game that provides English-speaking players with a way to learn Japanese through gameplay.
- (Exploration) To explore the potential and limitations of LLMs as a design material for game development.

The game will consist of three scenes:

- Title Scene
- VN (visual novel) Scene
- Study Scene

The player will start on the Title Scene, which may have some options to toggle to customize the game experience (TBD). They will then click a button to start the VN Scene, which is where the majority of the game takes place. There are four UI elements in the VN Scene:

- A background image, such as a landscape or a room.
- Character sprites in front of the background image, showing a vignette of the character's face and body that the player is currently interacting with.
- A chat section in front of the background image and character sprites, where the character dialog is displayed.
- A selection of multiple-choice dialog options (max 3) that the player can click on as their choice of what their character says in the scene to the other characters.

Because this is a game intended for language learning, there will be opportunities in the VN Scene to select language (i.e., a phrase said by a character or the dialog options available to the player) and enter a focused study session for that phrase, which is where the Study Scene comes in. After completing the Study Scene, the player will return to the VN Scene, where the game will continue. These opportunities will be indicated by a button in the VN Scene next to the chat section.

The Study Scene will take the text associated with the portion of the dialog that the player chose to study and present it in a way that allows the player to examine it more closely. For example, with pronunciation (romaji) and English translation. A "Back" button will return the player to the VN Scene.

The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

Ensure we have everything we need in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file to direct the construction of our game scenes. It may be the case that our current documentation is sufficient, but this is the time to double check. When you show that you have completed this, and I agree with your edits, we will move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Do not move on to implementing anything, however, until you have my confirmation.

---

We have added a new file `/docs/Game-Design.md` (@Game-Design.md) that contains a detailed design for the visual novel game (locations and characters). Take a look and think about how we might add details to this that would help our development. Does everything make sense with regard to how the scenes should progress, what content we will want to include in each scene, what images we will need for each scene, and so on?

---

We have added a new file `/docs/Game-LLM-Prompts.md` (@Game-LLM-Prompts.md) that discusses how we will use LLMs to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation. Take a look and think about how we might add details to this that would help our development. Does everything make sense with regard to how we will query the LLMs for specific data with regard to the game design?

(Interaction Guidelines: @Prompt-Header.md)
(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md)

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We currently have a shell of a project, consisting of a lightweight Streamlit app that loads a Phaser game for the user. We are now moving to Phase 2 of our Action Plan, where we will build the scenes for our game, starting with a base Scene class to serve as the foundation for the scenes we will build afterward.

Once I can confirm for you the successful implementation of the tasks in our current sub-phase (2.1), we can continue on to others.

---

Great! We have completed Step 2.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file (let's go ahead and update the file to reflect that). Let's move on to Step 2.2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We want the game to automatically load the Title Scene when the user first opens the game. For now, this can simply be a background image (title.png) that takes up the full game screen - (what is our game's canvas size, by the way?). Remember that you can create any stand-in image you need to via the CLI (ImageMagick) `convert` command (and we should create them as we encounter need of them).

When you show that you have completed this, and I agree with your edits, we will move on to the next step of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Do not move on to implementing anything, however, until you have my confirmation.

---

(For other project with working Phaser game):

In this project, we have many smaller projects, one of which is a Phaser game. In particular, check out the files in the `games/kanji-snake` directory (@kanji-snake) and its subdirectories.  We have been successful in loading images in this game (for instance, `games/kanji-snake/assets/titlebanner.png`), but I have a friend who is also trying to build a Phaser game and is having significant trouble even getting images to load.

I don't want you to actually do any development work here, but rather I wanted you to help me write a how-to document for structuring a Streamlit app to run a Phaser game. The document we want to write should be called `docs/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md).  Please write this document in a way that is easy to understand and follow that explains how to structure the Phaser game (e.g., where to put the assets directory), and how to get one of the images in that directory to render in the game.  If it makes any difference, my friend is using Streamlit as a simple wrapper to present the game to the user.

---

We seem to be stuck, and I think it is a problem with our foundation for the Phaser game.  I have a friend who has created Phaser games before (using React as a frontend), and I asked him to write a how-to document for developing a Phaser game that is run within a Streamlit app.  He has written a document that you can find in the `docs/reference/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md).  Look this over and compare it to how we have set up our project.  Come back with a list of things you can see we would need to change to follow his recommendations, and write them to a new file `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` (@Phaser-Rewrite.md).  We can then move forward from there.

DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO CODE. This is strictly a documentation task. This is an investigation into the problem, not a development task. Consider our current project structure, tools, and approach, and then compare it to the recommendations in the `Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file.  Your response should be a compilation of changes written to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

[Chat] on #4 in @Phaser-Rewrite.md, we have a choice between moving the built Phaser game to a dot folder or embedding the game directly in the Streamlit app.  The latter sounds preferable, since the only purpose of the Streamlit app is as a convenient wrapper for displaying the game, and it is not intended that it will ever serve any other game, so modularization doesn't seem necessary.  However, I would like to know your thoughts.

---

Let's talk about the Javascript vs. TypeScript decision presented in the feature plan.  I'm inclined to go with TypeScript, but let's make that certain in the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.  Beyond this, are there any other decisions to be made or uncertainties that should be addressed before we would begin to make these changes?  If you edit anything, it must be limited to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

That is a great list. Let's start with #1 (Development Environment Setup) - It seems like our new direction will involve Vite and Typescript, so there is very little chance that we won't be using NPM, correct (is there another way)? As for other team members, they should be covered by changes to the documentation that we make following this migration. As for #2 (Build Process Integration), there seem to be significant advantages to automating the build process and adding watch mode, so let's do that. For #3 (Asset Organization), it is not important to the development team where the assets are stored within the project, so let's go with the simplest approach that will minimize the number of steps needed to build and minimize potential points of failure.  For #4 (Backward Compatibility), we are early in the project and there is no need to worry about the previous implementation working; it will be fully replaced, so let's just move forward with whatever will mean the least amount of work for us. For #5 (Testing Strategy), let us not be concerned with testing yet, since we are just starting to build the project.


---

Let's add a #6 to our "Specific Changes Needed" section that covers updates to our project documentation and build commands.  For instance, we will want to make sure we update the `README.md` file to reflect the changes we have made to the project, especially if we are using new tools like Vite, NPM, and Typescript.  We will also want to make sure we update the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file to reflect the changes we have made to the project. All of this should be considered carefully so that nothing is missed, and let's add this to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

One final review of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.  Let's make sure that we have everything we need in the file to move forward with the implementation, given our discussions and decisions we've made.  I want this document to be thorough such that I could hand it to someone unfamiliar with our conversation and they would be able to perform this migration. At the very bottom, add a "Action Plan" section that provides step-by-step checkboxes for everything we will do and the order we will do them in. Be as detailed as possible. If you edit anything, it must be limited to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

Does this include a watchdog development workflow? One of the great things about the other project is when any change is made to the Phaser game code, the webpage displaying the game automatically updates to reflect the changes.  I don't know if this requires watchdog in both the Phaser and Streamlit parts of the project, but we definitely want to create this kind of setup for ease of development.

---

One last update to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file, specifically the "Action Plan" section.  These are great steps outlined, but I would rather not do it all in one shot and then evaluate if we succeeded.  It is MUCH better to take it step-by-step and evaluate as we go along. Looking at the Action Plan, do you see any places that are natural or convenient stopping points for us to pause and ensure that everything we've done to that point is functional?  It doesn't have to be after every step, but certainly there are key places where it would be natural to pause and evaluate.  Can you mark these places with some kind of special character sequence or reserved phrase that we can reference in the future?  When you mark these places, can you also indicate the steps that someone would need to take to ensure that everything is working as expected (for example, a developer or one of our QA team)?

---

This is great! Could you also do the same for our `docs/Action-Plan.md` (@Action-Plan.md) file for the overall project? Use your intuition to determine the natural stopping points for us to pause and evaluate, and mark these with [Checkpoint] instructions.

---

Finally, add a new item in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file between Step 2.1 (our past completed step) and Step 2.2 (our current step that is being postponed until we perform this migration) that summarizes this migration work (outlined in `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md`) so we can have a record of it.

(Interaction Guidelines: @Prompt-Header.md)
(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md)

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We are currently on Phase 2.1.5 (Phaser Implementation Rewrite) of our Action Plan.

In summary, before we can continue on (i.e., Phase 2.2) with our Action Plan, we found issues with our existing project structure that we need to address. We have taken the insight from a friend who has successfully built Phaser projects and provided us with a guide in the `docs/reference/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md). We have examined our own project and come up with a plan to re-write our Phaser game and have documented that plan in `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` (@Phaser-Rewrite.md).

Our task is now to implement the changes outlined in the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file. In that file is an Action Plan that we will follow, stopping at [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track. Let's begin!

---

Excellent job, and [CHECKPOINT] is cleared. The project file structure doc `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md) has been updated to reflect the changes we have made. Let's move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` feature Action Plan, stopping at the next [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track.
