We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game using Phaser.

(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md - Please remember this Project File Structure for determining where to find files in our project, what folders exist, etc.)
(Game Design: @Game-Design.md - Please remember this Game Design for understanding the design of the game, the locations, characters, events, etc.)

We are currently examining the dialog for the game, written out in `docs/Fallback-Dialog.md`. The pieces of dialog in this file mirror the dialog entries in the game files. We want to make edits to the overall script of the game here in this file and have those changes echo back to their corresponding entries in the game files.

There are portions I will want you to write new dialog for (with phrase identifiers as written in the file). Note that whatever changes we make here, WE MUST ALSO MAKE THE CORRESPONDING CHANGE TO THE GAME FILES:

- 1.1.6.2: Player response "ちょっと待って。お土産を買いたいんですが。" should be something that would better flow with Kaori's subsequent response (1.1.7). It seems odd that the player would be wanting to divert from the plan to get on the train to buy souvenirs but then have Kaori agree (and then they end up on the train). To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. It should be something that could be naturally followed by Kaori's response.

---

Perfect! Excellent work, let's continue with another scene.

- 2.1.3.1: Player statement should not be so affirmative that Kaori's response in 2.1.4 is not believable. She says "そうですね…初めてなら" which implies that the player has expressed some inexperience. To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. Note that our rewrite for 2.1.3.1 should still be meaningfully different from 2.1.3.2 to give the player an actual choice.
- 2.1.6.2: Player statement should be of a nature that that Kaori's response in 2.1.7 is natural. She says "じゃあ、入りましょう。" which implies that the player has expressed a desire to enter the restaurant. To be clear, it is the player's statement that should be edited, not Kaori's subsequent response. Note that our rewrite for 2.1.6.2 should still be meaningfully different from 2.1.6.1 to give the player an actual choice.

---

Well done, next scene!

- 2.2.7: Kaori's statement is repetitive of her earlier statement in 2.1.4. It can still reference set meal, but it should be relevant to both potential preceding player statements (2.2.6.1 and 2.2.6.2), and it should be written in a way that is natural given that the topic was already being discussed (vs. brought up as if a new idea).

---

Well done, next scene!

- 3.1.4: Kaori's statement should be something that can follow naturally from either of the player's potential statements (3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2). Currently, it really only naturally would follow 3.1.3.2.
- 3.1.7: Remove the introduction of the わび・さび concept. We should move the discussion of this concept to the park bench scene (3.2), where we will be rewriting the topic of conversation. There is no need to update the 3.2 dialog, we will do that after completing this step.

---

Awesome. Now for a little more complex rewrite:

- 3.2.4-3.2.8: Let's rewrite this entirely.  Instead of having a conversation about interests, let's have Kaori teach us the わび・さび concept. Let's not have the scene end on a player response option.

---

Well done, next scene!

- 4.1.7: Remove the mention of Tokyo Banana
- 4.1.9.1: Since the next scene (4.2) is a store where Kaori will buy a handbag (which we will be rewriting), let's not express the player's desire to go to a souvenir shop, but rather just have them express a desire to go see the stores.  Do not start editing 4.2 yet
- 4.1.9.2: The characters just ate at a restaurant, so let's create a new response for the player that is relevant to that situation.

---

Great! Now another more complex rewrite:

- 4.2: Change this from a clothing store and focus on a yukata to a handbag store where we can primarily focus on Kaori's purchase of a handbag. Player options might regard general descriptions of things (not specific to handbags) like colors, large/small, or affordable/expensive.

We have a small bug before we can continue to Phase 4.2 - the "Study" button is visible in the player response option dialogs, but somehow it has disappeared from the main dialog box (i.e., containing the character's statements).  It used to be visible - actually TOO visible (it would persist even when the dialog box disappeared), so we may have tried some "aggressive" techniques to remove it.  I think we went to far and now it doesn't show up at all. The code for this should mostly be in `phaser_game/src/scenes/VNScene.ts` @VNScene.ts

---

The "Study" button is still not visible.  Add debugging statements in the places where you create and destroy the Study button for the main dialog (again, player response option dialog boxes are working perfectly) that are prefixed with "[SB1]".  I will run the app and give you the logs so you can determine where the problem is.

Here are the logs from the point where the VNScene is loaded:

We see the initial dialog statement from the narrator, then we click once to advance to Kaori's greeting.  In spite of the logs declaring the button created, the study button is never visible in the dialog box ever: not in either the narrator statement or Kaori's statement.

Think carefully about this.  Our game screen is 1200x800, yet you are creating the button at 1100x870.  That is off the screen.  We need to figure out why this is happening. We don't need an "alternate" position for the button, we need to look at the code that is calculating this position and get it right.

---

This is progress, at least. The button is visible, but it should be green (not orange), and it's up against the right edge of the screen instead of associated with the top-right corner of the dialog box.  Again, I will mention that the study buttons for the player response options are working perfectly.  Maybe you should be looking at the code for those to inform how you are creating this one.  It should be the same thing, just for a different dialog box.

We are now on Phase 4.2. Let's continue our design of the "Study Scene" that we can reach by clicking the "Study" button in the top-right corner of any dialog. This brings up the scene in our StudyScene.ts file with the phrase/info regarding the text in the dialog from which the user clicked the "Study" button.

We are not implementing anything yet, we are just coming up with our feature design, which is documented in `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md`. Let's continue to discuss the design.

All study sessions begin with a phrase in Japanese - we will call this the "source phrase". We will then send this phrase (along with an instruction prompt) to generate data to return based on that phrase. Then, we will display that information in the Study Scene.  At the moment, the scene does not need to be interactive, but we need to figure out what to display.

So to begin our design: If you were an English speaker wanting to learn Japanese that initiated a study session for a Japanese phrase, what are the kinds of things you would want to know about that phrase?  What are the kinds of things that we could display?

For inpiration, read through our earlier brainstorming in these files:
- `docs/Technical-Spec.md` - in the "Study Scene" section we talk about the types of data we would want to display
- `docs/Game-LLM-Prompts.md` - Since ultimately this data will come from an LLM, earlier in the project we experimented with creating prompts that could be used to generate this data from the source phrase using an LLM.
- `phaser_game/src/data/conversations/park_bench.ts` - This a portion of the dialog for our "fallback" dialog script (i.e., our test dialog) in which you can see there are some attempts to capture "Studyable Terms" relevant to the dialog (source phrase). Though we are not intending to use this particular data, it is still useful for our design.
- `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md` - This is our existing design for the Study Scene, but it needs to be rewritten.  It was designed by someone who did not have a firm grasp on our goals and ended up creating something too complex.  We only have one page to work with, so our design will be much simpler.

Please update the `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md` file with your design and insights. Let's start small - be thorough about POSSIBILIES of what kind of information we could include, but there is no need to flesh them all out yet.  We'll pare it down to reach our final design, but we would like to get a sense of the opportunities and brainstorm ideas to start.  Feel free to keep or discard any part of the existing file.

After your edits, we will continue our discussion.

---

This looks good.  Take a look at the existing code file for the scene in `phaser_game/src/scenes/StudyScene.ts`.  This has a few of the design elements we discussed, though you are free to discard any of it as you see fit. However, knowing what you want to keep or discard might help in our design of the spec. I think visually I agree with your design in the spec, and compared to the existing implementation I would like for it to take up the large majority of the screen (i.e., thin borders allowing the VNScene to be visible in the background) but not as much as it has currently. We want as much room as possible.

We discussed Phaser support for scrollable content, and it would make sense for us to have the "Top Section" static while having the "Main Content Area" vertically scrollable. Whether we accomplish this through Phaser's native library or make use of something like `rex-ui` is up to you. While Phaser supports scrolling for say, a scrollable level, we are simply using it for UI, so determine what wouuld be most appropriate.

You have also separated the information well among "Must-Have Information", "Include When Relevant", and "Optional Information". This will help us when working with the LLM - some information we will demand to have, but our system should be flexible to make other items optional in the case that the LLM does not return information for them.

Erase the section on "Considerations for Different Learner Levels" - this is far too nuanced for our current scope. We will present a uniform experience to the player regardless of their level. Rather, their level will determine how often they voluntarily initiate study sessions.

I've added "(NOTYET)" markers throughout the spec, following our convention in other specs for ideas that are worth keeping in mind but are not in the current scope.

For our initial implementation, we will need no interactability other than being able to "Return to Game" or to (if needed) vertically scroll the "Main Content Area".

Update the spec to integrate these comments and add the extremely important "Feature Implementation Plan (FIP)" section that you see exemplified in the feature spec template (`docs/read-only/Feature-Spec-Template.md`). Keep in mind that your only instruction at this moment is to read files (those specified above and any others you deem necessary) and to update the feature spec file `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md`. Don't be thrown off by the checkboxes you create for the FIP and suddenly think you need to start implementing the shiny new list you just created.

After your edits, we will continue our discussion.

---

Looking good, a few remaining edits:
- Remove mention of furigana, we have dropped that feature in the MVP. 
- Remove :source context" from Essential Information - we will be doing something different with referencing the previous dialog. 
- Return the paragraph regarding "(NOTYET)" so that human readers will understand what this marking means throughout the document. 
- Include my notes on how our separation of information groups will help us remain flexible while working with an unpredictable LLM. 
- Include a new Phase between Phase 1 & 2 that includes creating test data (not for tests, but for developing around). This will require some work and refinement to create a good test case to implement our UI with.

After your edits, we will continue our discussion.

---

# Cursor changed its models. We no longer have access to the claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking, but just the claude-3.5-sonnet with a thinking toggle (and claude-3.5-sonnet "Max").

---

This looks great.  I think we are ready to implement this.

---

Please update the feature spec FIP to reflect the progress of the implementation.

The Study Scene looks pretty good, I especially like how the scrollable content is handled. Let's make the following edits:

- Remove the Test Study button (and be sure to remove other code that was written strictly to support it). We do not want to clutter our game scene with test buttons.
- Change the "Back to Game" to simply "Back"
- The horizontal lines that go beneath section titles are not centered in the main content area - see screenshot image attached.

---

the line wrapping will need to be performed manually just as we do with the main dialog box and the player selection options dialog boxes.  in the study scene, they will have a maximum limit of 31 characters

---

Take another look at how the dialog box and player selection options dialog boxes handle line wrapping.  We will need to do the same thing in the Study Scene. Do they also wrap the romaji or english translation... or just the Japanese phrase? Please think carefully.

---

Great. Can we add formatting to the romaji and english translation that makes it share in the same design as we use in the VNScene dialog boxes (i.e., smaller font size, brackets surrounding the translation text, translation text in a bluish color)?

---

If we find that the target phrase needed to be wrapped to an additional line, we will need to move down the top of the scrollable content area.  Right now we do not account for this, so the areas collide (see screenshot image attached).  Note that this will involve making the scrollable content area smaller in order to remain within the bounds of the scene.

---

A small bug: when we click the "Back" button to return to the VNScene, it also registers as a click in the VNScene, causing the dialog to advance.  How can we prevent this?

---

Opening to the beginning of the game and clicking the study button for the narrator dialog, then immediately clicking the "Back" button to return to the VNScene:

```
Opening Study Scene with phrase: 東京駅に到着しました。ホームに立っていると...
VNScene.ts:1154 VNScene paused, StudyScene launched
VNScene.ts:652 [DEBUG] VNScene - Pointer down detected at 1106.5 559
VNScene.ts:663 [DEBUG] VNScene - Processing pointer down event (not ignored)
...
VNScene.ts:1879 [DEBUG] VNScene - ignoreNextInput flag value before delay: true
index.ts:146 🎮 Active scenes: TitleScene
```

---

OK, you are having some trouble server-wise connecting.  Here's what I'm going to try.  I'm going to git reset the repo to the last commit before we began investigating this issue regarding the back button.  please re-apply your fix above with the insight we made in the investigation, and this way we can easily "remove" all of the extra clutter and attempts that we made when we didn't fully understand the problem.  Are you able to do that? the git repository is reset (StudyScene.ts and VNScene.ts are back at their state prior to this investigation, you may need to re-read them). @StudyScene.ts @VNScene.ts

It is time for us to start integrating the LLM into our project.  We will start with the "Study" button in the VNScene. Given a target phrase, we will send this phrase and a set of instructions to an LLM and request back data necessary for populating the Study Scene. Here are some important files:

  - `docs/features/Study-Scene-Layout.md`: This is our feature spec for the Study Scene, including the layout and the information we will display.
  - `phaser_game/src/data/study/test-phrase-data.ts`: This is our test data for the Study Scene that we used during the design phase. However, it shows the kind of data that we will need to generate from the LLM.
  - `docs/Game-LLM-Prompts.md`: This is our past attempts at prompts for the LLM that we will use to generate the data for the main game dialog as well as the Study Scene. It likely needs to be updated now that we've finished our Study Scene design and have a better understanding of the data we need to generate.

Some things we need to do:
1) Compare our old Game LLM Prompts spec with the new Study Scene design (and test data example) to update the Game LLM Prompts spec with the more finalized data needs.
2) Integrate LLM communication into our project. We should use the openai library for this, where details regarding the API key and model will be handled through the `.env` file.
3) Implement code in our Study Scene that takes the target phrase and uses the LLM to generate the data for the Study Scene. I believe our Study Scene currently has some filler content to display while we wait for the LLM to generate the data. This filler data should also include a message to the user to briefly wait.
4) Display the data in the Study Scene when it is returned from the LLM.
5) Surely many other things.

Our task for right now is a documentation task (not an implementation task!). This is a big feature, so we should create a feature spec for it. Pay special attention to your rules regarding feature specs and documentation-related tasks. Please create a new document `docs/features/Study-Scene-LLM-Integration.md` that describes what we need to do to integrate the LLM into the Study Scene. You can use the feature spec template (`docs/read-only/Feature-Spec-Template.md`) as a guide.

Your only task... your ONLY ASSIGNED TASK for the moment... is to create and populate this new feature spec document.

---

Looks good. A few thoughts (some of which are edits you should make to the feature spec using the edit_file tool):

- Since this is one of a few places we will be querying the LLM, should we create a new class that provides functions as a service to our project? For instance, our first addition to this new class would be a function that takes a target phrase and returns the data for the Study Scene. It would handle the LLM communication itself, and we would not need to clutter our Study Scene with the details of the LLM communication. It looks like we may be doing this already with the LLMClient class, but let's make sure that when we determine our divisions, we are favoring putting the least amount of code in the Study Scene.
- Though we are using the openai library, we want to be able to support any LLM provider that implements the same API (where the OpenAI API has become a standard that many LLM providers have implemented). Therefore, our `.env` file might need a few more variables to support this. Ensure, for example, that we would be able to run this with a "local" LLM model like Llama or Mistral running on localhost or a home network.
- Remove the concerns regarding the Streamlit app - we have cut that feature from the MVP version of the project.
- Our current UI does not need approximate loading time indicators (I'm not sure how we would accomplish this). But a message to the user (required) and an animation (if possible, not required) would be nice.
- Include in our FIP a task for updating the Game-LLM-Prompts.md file to reflect the new data needs and prompt.

---

I think you misunderstand the need to work with multiple API providers.  It uses the openai library, but all that changes is the server URL/IP.  If we want to use OpenAI proper, we can do that, and if we want to use a local model, we just change it to 127.0.0.1.  I don't think you need to complicate the LLMService class with separate functions to distinguish between them, nor do I think you need to use "openai" and "local" as enumerated options in the `.env` file. The openai library is just a wrapper that defines the communication protocol. Is this incorrect?

I've added documentation for using the openai library to the project: `docs/reference/Openai-Library.md` (@Openai-Library.md). Please read it and let me know if you think we need to do anything differently. Update (edit_file tool) the feature spec if needed.

Obviously, this guide was written for a general audience, so not all of the information is to be taken literally (like the project file structure), but it should provide enough information for us to accomplish our task.

---











Please update the feature spec to reflect the progress of the implementation.
