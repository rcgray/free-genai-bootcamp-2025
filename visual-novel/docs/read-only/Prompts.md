We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game using Phaser.

(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md - Please remember this Project File Structure for determining where to find files in our project, what folders exist, etc.)

(Action Plan: @Action-Plan.md - Please remember this Action Plan for understanding the plan for building the project, identifying previously completed work, identifying the current phase and upcoming [CHECKPOINT].)

We are currently examining the dialog for the game, written out in `docs/Fallback-Dialog.md`. The pieces of dialog in this file mirror the dialog entries in the game files. We want to make edits to the overall script of the game here in this file and have those changes echo back to their corresponding entries in the game files.

There are portions I will want you to write new dialog for (with phrase identifiers as written in the file):

- 1.1 Train Platform
  - Player response "ちょっと待って。お土産を買いたいんですが。" should be something that would better flow with Kaori's response. It seems odd that the player would be wanting to divert from the plan to get on the train to buy souvenirs but then have Kaori agree (and then they end up on the train).
- 1.2 Inside Train
  -
- 2.1 Outside Restaurant
  - Kaori's response "そうですね…初めてなら"
- 2.2 Inside Restaurant
  -
- 3.1 Park Lawn
  -
- 3.2 Park Bench
  -
- 4.1 Outside Mall
  -
- 4.2 Clothing Store
  -
- 5.1 Hotel Lobby
  -
