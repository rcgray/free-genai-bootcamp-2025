We are setting up a new project, using some of the files from previous projects as a starting point. Please follow the instructions in `dev/template/Project-Setup.md` (@Project-Setup.md) up to Step 3.3 Dynamic Documentation, where we will then work together to generate the core project specifications files.

---
# git commit
# Run `python scripts/update_docs.py`
---

Perfectly done! Here is our new project file structure: (@Project-File-Structure.md) Now let's work together to generate the core project specifications files. Keep in mind that we are now working from the instructions in the copy of `Project-Setup.md` (@Project-Setup.md) in the root of the project folder that you have copied and edited.

We'll start with the `docs/PRD.md` file, and only the `docs/PRD.md` file. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/PRD.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/PRD.md` file for this project.

This project aims to create a game in Python that runs in the browser and operates similar to a Renpy visual novel. In fact, the closer we can make it to implementing Renpy's visual novel engine, the better. The game will be written in Japanese for English-speaking players that are looking to learn Japanese through gameplay. The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and process study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

The primary goals of this project are:
- (Functional) To create a simple engine for crafting web-based visual novel game experiences.
- (Design) To design a game that provides English-speaking players with a way to learn Japanese through gameplay.
- (Exploration) To explore the potential and limitations of LLMs as a design material for game development.

The game will consist of three scenes:

- Title Scene
- VN (visual novel) Scene
- Study Scene

The player will start on the Title Scene, which may have some options to toggle to customize the game experience (TBD). They will then click a button to start the VN Scene, which is where the majority of the game takes place. There are four UI elements in the VN Scene:

- A background image, such as a landscape or a room.
- Character sprites in front of the background image, showing a vignette of the character's face and body that the player is currently interacting with.
- A chat section in front of the background image and character sprites, where the character dialog is displayed.
- A selection of multiple-choice dialog options (max 3) that the player can click on as their choice of what their character says in the scene to the other characters.

Because this is a game intended for language learning, there will be opportunities in the VN Scene to select language (i.e., a phrase said by a character or the dialog options available to the player) and enter a focused study session for that phrase, which is where the Study Scene comes in. After completing the Study Scene, the player will return to the VN Scene, where the game will continue. These opportunities will be indicated by a button in the VN Scene next to the chat section.

The Study Scene will take the text associated with the portion of the dialog that the player chose to study and present it in a way that allows the player to examine it more closely. For example, with pronunciation (romaji) and English translation. A "Back" button will return the player to the VN Scene.

The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

Great! Now we'll move to the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, and only the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/Technical-Spec.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file for this project.

We will write the game using the Phaser game engine. Here is documentation for Phaser, which has been added to Cursor:

- Phaser General Documentation: (@Phaser General Documentation) - https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser
- Phaser API Documentation: (@Phaser API Documentation) - https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/api-documentation

Toolset:
- Python 3.12+
- Phaser (current version is 3.88.2)
- Ruff
- MyPy
- Pytest
- TinyDB (not initially, but intended for later)
- OpenAI

Notes:
- Though we will manually run commands like ruff and mypy, we wil not create any pre-commit hooks.
- This project will not use a database initially. If and when we decide to add one, we will use TinyDB.
- We are intentionally not using RenPy for this project, but rather we are attempting to create a similar experience using Phaser.
- We will interact with an LLM backend via a REST API using the OpenAI standard. This does not necessarily mean that we will use OpenAI, but rather that we will use a standard that is compatible with OpenAI and have the flexibility to change providers later if we wish.

Please be sure to include a section for the documentation links in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file.

---
# if needed:
---

This `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file is a good start, but it is missing a lot of my notes from the previous prompt, such as the definition of the MVP and the featuers we will not be aiming to build initially. Let's take another pass at it and include additional detail regarding our implementation priorities and what we're aiming to build as our foundation. Again, we are working in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, and only the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file.

Also add a note regarding the local models we would prefer to use (they were listed a few prompts ago).  Add a section on documentation web references we've included in Cursor so far so that we have easy reference of it.  

---

That sounds great! Now we will take everything we've created so far (the `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/Technical-Spec.md` files and, at an even higher priority, the notes from my past prompts) and make sure we integrate these notes into our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. This file is the most important of all the files we've created so far, and it is the one that will guide our work from here on out. Don't forget that you can use the `dev/template/docs/Action-Plan.md` file as a reference for the format of the new `docs/Action-Plan.md` file for this project.

How will we create our MVP, step-by-step? We want to be able to build our application following the steps from top-to-bottom, so ordering of steps is important. In determining this order, consider three factors:

- **MVP Priority**: How can we best enforce our priorities for the features in the construction of this plan? Perhaps our earliest steps should be to get the scenes working with the Phaser engine with static text before we work on more complex features like LLM integration. It is useful to set up CLI scripts that can test initially before we test the UI manually.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that the order of the steps reflects dependencies, where we build dependencies first before ordering other tasks that would depend on them.
- **Implementation Complexity**: Ensure that the steps are as simple as possible, moving into complexity later. It's ok to have an implementation focus "split" across multiple steps, if only part of it is a dependency and the rest is optional or more complex.  

Remember that we are carefully considering multiple sources in constructing this plan:

- The `docs/PRD.md` file
- The `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file
- The notes from my past prompts in this conversation

Let's take a shot at building the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file, and only the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

---

Nice work. Now that we have our Action Plan, please use your intuition regarding the work items to determine when natural stopping points occur, and let us be sure to include [Checkpoint] instructions at these natural stopping points for us to pause and evaluate. Mark these with [Checkpoint] instructions.

---

Great! We have completed section 3.2 of the `Project-Setup.md` file. Update our progress in the `Project-Setup.md` file.

---
# git commit
---

We will skip Section 3.3 of the `Project-Setup.md` file, marking these items as `[~]` (intentionally skipped). We will move on to Section 3.4, where these Tool Files should be naturally created in the course of completing Step 1.1 in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Note that in creating our tools files, if there are any that are not applicable, they should be individually marked as `[~]` (intentionally skipped).

So let's move to implementing Step 1.1 in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file and create our basic project, where many of these steps will naturally check off some boxes in the `Project-Setup.md` file for Step 3.4.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You may have a temptation to go further and actually start implementing aspects of the project, but please do not.  Right now we must follow the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file as it is our guide.  We will update it as we go along, but for now we must follow it as written. We are working on Step 1.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file to create our basic project structure so we can finish out the rest of the steps in the `Project-Setup.md` file.

---
# if needed
---

We were just intending to do Step 1.1 from the @Action-Plan.md Action Plan fileand set up our project structure, though it appears you have gone ahead and implemented some significant portions of the project already. This is not optimal, but we'll move forward with it.  However, in the course of that implementation you made some technical decisions (such as to use Streamlit, which was never specified).  Please review the choices that you made in this implementation and update the @Technical-Spec.md Technical-Spec.md document to include any other assumptions or technologies you've chosen to add to our implementation

---
# edit the pyproject.toml file or package.json file to include my info
---


Beautiful! our final step in the Project-Setup.md file (Step 4: Wrap-Up) is to evaluate the previously copied files for applicability to the new project, adding or removing elements as needed. Now that we've set up our tools and defined our tech stack, we should be able to update our `.gitignore`, `.cursorignore`, `.cursorrules`, `.env.example`, etc. files to better suit our project.

We can then update our `Project-Setup.md` and `Action-Plan.md` files to reflect the changes.

---

# Dev Steps:
- Git commit everything
- Create conda env or uv venv or what is needed
- Install tools & dependencies, `uv sync --extra dev`, etc.
- Set up .env from .env.example
- Move (now completed) Project-Setup.md to the /docs/read-only directory
- Delete the `dev/template` folder (optional)
- Run `scripts/update_docs.py` script again

- Start a new chat, pick up where we left off in the Action Plan

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file (@Project-File-Structure.md). Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We are working within a conda environment called `vn` so please include activating that environment in your commands. Additionally, we are using uv to manage our dependencies, so please include that in your commands.

Our project tools are set up as indicated in `Project-Setup.md`. Now it is time for us to start building the project GRADUALLY via the plan in `docs/Action-Plan.md`.

First, let's make sure that our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file is up to date.  There may be work we've already done that we can use to check off items in the plan.

---

Since our project setup is complete, we have moved the Project-Setup.md file to the `docs/` directory and will not need to reference it again.

It appears we have completed Step 1.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We've now decided to serve our Phaser game using Streamlit (which is not part of the original plan).  We may need to make updates both to our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file and our `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file and possibly the `README.md` file to reflect this change.  I want to make sure that all three of these files are in sync with each other.  If there are any inconsistencies, let's discuss them.

---

Excellent.  Let's move on to Step 1.2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. In general, we will want to implement as much of our project within the Phaser game, not the Streamlit wrapper.  We may add some utilities and UI outside the game to aid development, but the goal for now is to minimize the Streamlit wrapper and intend to implement as much as possible within the Phaser game itself.

---

Good job, and thank you for remembering to limit your actions to only those requested in the prompt's latest, explicit instructions.  Let's move on to Step 1.3 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. A new file `docs/Prompt-Notes.md` has been added to the project to provide some notes to consider with every prompt as we develop our project. Please review it and keep it in mind as we continue to develop our project.

---

Fantastic. The `docs/Prompt-Notes.md` file has been updated as well, so I'm including it again in the prompt.

Before we move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file, let's make sure that we have a solid plan for the scenes that we will be building. The documentation for this is sparse in our `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file, so let's take a moment to review the current state of the file and make sure that we flesh out some details. As a reminder:

The primary goals of this project are:
- (Functional) To create a simple engine for crafting web-based visual novel game experiences.
- (Design) To design a game that provides English-speaking players with a way to learn Japanese through gameplay.
- (Exploration) To explore the potential and limitations of LLMs as a design material for game development.

The game will consist of three scenes:

- Title Scene
- VN (visual novel) Scene
- Study Scene

The player will start on the Title Scene, which may have some options to toggle to customize the game experience (TBD). They will then click a button to start the VN Scene, which is where the majority of the game takes place. There are four UI elements in the VN Scene:

- A background image, such as a landscape or a room.
- Character sprites in front of the background image, showing a vignette of the character's face and body that the player is currently interacting with.
- A chat section in front of the background image and character sprites, where the character dialog is displayed.
- A selection of multiple-choice dialog options (max 3) that the player can click on as their choice of what their character says in the scene to the other characters.

Because this is a game intended for language learning, there will be opportunities in the VN Scene to select language (i.e., a phrase said by a character or the dialog options available to the player) and enter a focused study session for that phrase, which is where the Study Scene comes in. After completing the Study Scene, the player will return to the VN Scene, where the game will continue. These opportunities will be indicated by a button in the VN Scene next to the chat section.

The Study Scene will take the text associated with the portion of the dialog that the player chose to study and present it in a way that allows the player to examine it more closely. For example, with pronunciation (romaji) and English translation. A "Back" button will return the player to the VN Scene.

The game will be supported by a Large Language Model (LLM) that will be used to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation.

Ensure we have everything we need in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file to direct the construction of our game scenes. It may be the case that our current documentation is sufficient, but this is the time to double check. When you show that you have completed this, and I agree with your edits, we will move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Do not move on to implementing anything, however, until you have my confirmation.

---

We have added a new file `/docs/Game-Design.md` (@Game-Design.md) that contains a detailed design for the visual novel game (locations and characters). Take a look and think about how we might add details to this that would help our development. Does everything make sense with regard to how the scenes should progress, what content we will want to include in each scene, what images we will need for each scene, and so on?

---

We have added a new file `/docs/Game-LLM-Prompts.md` (@Game-LLM-Prompts.md) that discusses how we will use LLMs to generate the dialog for the game and provide dynamic content for the study objectives such as pronunciation and translation. Take a look and think about how we might add details to this that would help our development. Does everything make sense with regard to how we will query the LLMs for specific data with regard to the game design?

(Interaction Guidelines: @Prompt-Header.md)
(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md)

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We currently have a shell of a project, consisting of a lightweight Streamlit app that loads a Phaser game for the user. We are now moving to Phase 2 of our Action Plan, where we will build the scenes for our game, starting with a base Scene class to serve as the foundation for the scenes we will build afterward.

Once I can confirm for you the successful implementation of the tasks in our current sub-phase (2.1), we can continue on to others.

---

Great! We have completed Step 2.1 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file (let's go ahead and update the file to reflect that). Let's move on to Step 2.2 of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.

We want the game to automatically load the Title Scene when the user first opens the game. For now, this can simply be a background image (title.png) that takes up the full game screen - (what is our game's canvas size, by the way?). Remember that you can create any stand-in image you need to via the CLI (ImageMagick) `convert` command (and we should create them as we encounter need of them).

When you show that you have completed this, and I agree with your edits, we will move on to the next step of the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. Do not move on to implementing anything, however, until you have my confirmation.

---

(For other project with working Phaser game):

In this project, we have many smaller projects, one of which is a Phaser game. In particular, check out the files in the `games/kanji-snake` directory (@kanji-snake) and its subdirectories.  We have been successful in loading images in this game (for instance, `games/kanji-snake/assets/titlebanner.png`), but I have a friend who is also trying to build a Phaser game and is having significant trouble even getting images to load.

I don't want you to actually do any development work here, but rather I wanted you to help me write a how-to document for structuring a Streamlit app to run a Phaser game. The document we want to write should be called `docs/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md).  Please write this document in a way that is easy to understand and follow that explains how to structure the Phaser game (e.g., where to put the assets directory), and how to get one of the images in that directory to render in the game.  If it makes any difference, my friend is using Streamlit as a simple wrapper to present the game to the user.

---

We seem to be stuck, and I think it is a problem with our foundation for the Phaser game.  I have a friend who has created Phaser games before (using React as a frontend), and I asked him to write a how-to document for developing a Phaser game that is run within a Streamlit app.  He has written a document that you can find in the `docs/reference/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md).  Look this over and compare it to how we have set up our project.  Come back with a list of things you can see we would need to change to follow his recommendations, and write them to a new file `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` (@Phaser-Rewrite.md).  We can then move forward from there.

DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO CODE. This is strictly a documentation task. This is an investigation into the problem, not a development task. Consider our current project structure, tools, and approach, and then compare it to the recommendations in the `Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file.  Your response should be a compilation of changes written to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

[Chat] on #4 in @Phaser-Rewrite.md, we have a choice between moving the built Phaser game to a dot folder or embedding the game directly in the Streamlit app.  The latter sounds preferable, since the only purpose of the Streamlit app is as a convenient wrapper for displaying the game, and it is not intended that it will ever serve any other game, so modularization doesn't seem necessary.  However, I would like to know your thoughts.

---

Let's talk about the Javascript vs. TypeScript decision presented in the feature plan.  I'm inclined to go with TypeScript, but let's make that certain in the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.  Beyond this, are there any other decisions to be made or uncertainties that should be addressed before we would begin to make these changes?  If you edit anything, it must be limited to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

That is a great list. Let's start with #1 (Development Environment Setup) - It seems like our new direction will involve Vite and Typescript, so there is very little chance that we won't be using NPM, correct (is there another way)? As for other team members, they should be covered by changes to the documentation that we make following this migration. As for #2 (Build Process Integration), there seem to be significant advantages to automating the build process and adding watch mode, so let's do that. For #3 (Asset Organization), it is not important to the development team where the assets are stored within the project, so let's go with the simplest approach that will minimize the number of steps needed to build and minimize potential points of failure.  For #4 (Backward Compatibility), we are early in the project and there is no need to worry about the previous implementation working; it will be fully replaced, so let's just move forward with whatever will mean the least amount of work for us. For #5 (Testing Strategy), let us not be concerned with testing yet, since we are just starting to build the project.


---

Let's add a #6 to our "Specific Changes Needed" section that covers updates to our project documentation and build commands.  For instance, we will want to make sure we update the `README.md` file to reflect the changes we have made to the project, especially if we are using new tools like Vite, NPM, and Typescript.  We will also want to make sure we update the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file to reflect the changes we have made to the project. All of this should be considered carefully so that nothing is missed, and let's add this to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

One final review of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.  Let's make sure that we have everything we need in the file to move forward with the implementation, given our discussions and decisions we've made.  I want this document to be thorough such that I could hand it to someone unfamiliar with our conversation and they would be able to perform this migration. At the very bottom, add a "Action Plan" section that provides step-by-step checkboxes for everything we will do and the order we will do them in. Be as detailed as possible. If you edit anything, it must be limited to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file.

---

Does this include a watchdog development workflow? One of the great things about the other project is when any change is made to the Phaser game code, the webpage displaying the game automatically updates to reflect the changes.  I don't know if this requires watchdog in both the Phaser and Streamlit parts of the project, but we definitely want to create this kind of setup for ease of development.

---

One last update to the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file, specifically the "Action Plan" section.  These are great steps outlined, but I would rather not do it all in one shot and then evaluate if we succeeded.  It is MUCH better to take it step-by-step and evaluate as we go along. Looking at the Action Plan, do you see any places that are natural or convenient stopping points for us to pause and ensure that everything we've done to that point is functional?  It doesn't have to be after every step, but certainly there are key places where it would be natural to pause and evaluate.  Can you mark these places with some kind of special character sequence or reserved phrase that we can reference in the future?  When you mark these places, can you also indicate the steps that someone would need to take to ensure that everything is working as expected (for example, a developer or one of our QA team)?

---

This is great! Could you also do the same for our `docs/Action-Plan.md` (@Action-Plan.md) file for the overall project? Use your intuition to determine the natural stopping points for us to pause and evaluate, and mark these with [Checkpoint] instructions.

---

Finally, add a new item in our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file between Step 2.1 (our past completed step) and Step 2.2 (our current step that is being postponed until we perform this migration) that summarizes this migration work (outlined in `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md`) so we can have a record of it.

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We are currently on Phase 2.1.5 (Phaser Implementation Rewrite) of our Action Plan.

In summary, before we can continue on (i.e., Phase 2.2) with our Action Plan, we found issues with our existing project structure that we need to address. We have taken the insight from a friend who has successfully built Phaser projects and provided us with a guide in the `docs/reference/Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md` file (@Streamlit-Phaser-Howto.md). We have examined our own project and come up with a plan to re-write our Phaser game and have documented that plan in `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` (@Phaser-Rewrite.md).

Our task is now to implement the changes outlined in the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file. In that file is an Action Plan that we will follow, stopping at [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track. Let's begin!

---

Excellent job, and [CHECKPOINT] is cleared. The project file structure doc `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md) has been updated to reflect the changes we have made. Let's move on to Phase 2 of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` feature Action Plan, stopping at the next [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track.

---

Excellent job, and [CHECKPOINT] is cleared. The project file structure doc `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md) has been updated to reflect the changes we have made. Let's update this file to mark our progress, then let's move on to Phase 3 of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` feature Action Plan, stopping at the next [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track.

---

I have updated the @Prompt-Header.md and the @.cursorrules files to prevent you from frequently changing directories. You seem to get often confused on where you are, and we should be creating commands that enable us to remain in the root directory of the project. If there is something that you can't run from the root directory, let me know. Please navigate back to the root directory, and let's continue.

---

OK, the [CHECKPOINT] is cleared. The project file structure doc `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md) has been updated to reflect the changes we have made. Let's update this file to mark our progress, then let's move on to Phase 4 of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` feature Action Plan, stopping at the next [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track.

---

OK, the [CHECKPOINT] is cleared. The project file structure doc `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md) has been updated to reflect the changes we have made. Let's update this file to mark our progress, then let's move on to Phase 5 of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` feature Action Plan, stopping at the next [CHECKPOINT] instructions to ensure we are on track.

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We are currently on Phase 2.2 (Phaser Implementation Rewrite) of our Action Plan.

Before we move on to Phase 2.2 of our Action Plan, let's make some small adjustments to our streamlit app. First, when we are in development mode, we get a few messages on the Streamlit page above the Phaser game, which say things like "Development mode active!..." and "Any changes to the Phaser game source files should be instantly reflected...".  Can we move those to below the game instead of above?  Second, our vite server (when we run `./scripts/watch-phaser.sh`) is extremely verbose, is there a way we can have it just alert us to the server running and HMR events, and not everything that it does?

---

In order to get hot-reload working, we eventually fell on a workaround by having the whole Phaser app reload whenever a change in the code was detected - this might be necessary and the way things are usually done (i don't know), but it would also be nice if you could change something in the game and have it update similar to how designing a webpage with React.js can be done with hot-reload where the changes in layout are immediately reflected in the open browser.  is this possible?  or should we expect to be kicked back out to the title screen every time we change any detail in the Phaser game code? I'm not super familiar with either Phaser or Vite.

Yeah, let's a great idea.  It also sounds like it would share functionality with a feature that allows for saving and loading a game.  What would this look like?  Please explain your development plan in a new file `docs/features/Scene-Specific-Reloading.md` and designed in a way that we could extend it in the future to enable saving a player's game (e.g., exporting JSON) and importing (e.g., importing JSON and taking the player to precisely that game state - scene & supporting state variables). And for now, we are focused on a better HMR experience.

Write up this feature in the `docs/features/Scene-Specific-Reloading.md` file and let's discuss further.

---

This is great.  Add a new work item to the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file just prior to 2.2 Title Scene that summaries the steps that need to be performed to implement this, followed by a [CHECKPOINT]. Once I confirm everything is correct, we can implement it.

---

Alright, let's do it - Phase 2.1.6 of our `docs/Action-Plan.md` Action Plan, which implements the steps outlined in the  spec document `docs/features/Scene-Specific-Reloading.md` for the feature we've been discussing.

# Dev notes

Many back-and-forth specific prompts (eventually switching to claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking to break a loop). The main goal was to perfect load/save for hot-reload functionality, and it was trickier than expected. 

- [x] Test and refine the state preservation system
  - [x] Fix registry serialization error
  - [x] Fix HMR integration to properly clean up old game instances
  - [x] Improve HMR state preservation to maintain game state across reloads

# New chat (Agent, claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking)

(Interaction Guidelines: @Prompt-Header.md)
(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md)

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game. Our project is a Streamlit app running a game that we are writing using Phaser.  Our project file structure can be found in the `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` file. Our PRD is in the `docs/PRD.md` file. Our Technical Spec is in the `docs/Technical-Spec.md` file. The design for the game (when we get there) is in the `docs/Game-Design.md` file. Our Action Plan is in the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file. We are currently on Phase 2.2 (Title Scene) of our Action Plan.

Our Title Scene can be very simple, and this task is nearly completed. Remove the title text (it will be integrated into the final background image).  Keep the Start Game button just as it is.  Let's add a button in the top right of just the title screen that causes the game to "reset" - i.e., it clears out any game state and prevents the auto-application of any HMR-related state to allow the player (or more importantly, the developer!) to completely reset the game - which is no longer possible with our recent HMR features.

---

Awesome. Let's update our `docs/Action-Plan.md` file.  Let's move on to create our Visual Novel Scene - Core (2.3 in our Action Plan)

---

[Feedback]The textbox for Cursor Chat (Windows 10) really needs some love:

 - It is too small (vertically)
 - It sometimes puts keyboard input at a location different than the cursor
 - Arrow navigation stops on the paragraph break, drag/dropping files (for @ references) sometimes overwrite existing text
 - Sometimes (like right now) it doesn't respond to keyboard input or Ctrl-V (paste) at all!  I have to constantly workaround by "Open Chat as Editor" -> drag chat window off of the app to create a new window for it -> "Open as Pane" to get it to receive keyboard input again for _one prompt_.

It's so unusable for anything more than quips that I generally have to write my prompts in another window and then copy-paste in to be able to craft prompts in my preferred style.

As the primary interaction with your product, this really grinds on the experience.

Feature request: as someone who often writes prompts in a different window, is there a way for the chat textbox to recognize @Filename in pasted text to automatically "link" them (blue) in the pasted prompt?

---

yes, let's create it, and then let's have the Start button on the Title Scene send the player to it.  In addition to the details discussed in @Technical-Spec.md , include a button in the bottom right of the VN scene that will take the player back to the Title Scene

---

It would seem in your creation of the VN Scene, you did not pay attention to the details of the game design discussed in `docs/Game-Design.md` ( @Game-Design.md ), which was given to you above.  For instance, there is no school scene, and you have the example of a key character (no need for a placeholder).  You have the list of all folders in the project via `docs/reports/Project-File-Structure.md` (@Project-File-Structure.md ), so you could have known it was not necessary to `mkdir -p assets/images/backgrounds`.  I'm just confused, because it doesn't appear that you are referencing the information you've been given, so please advise on how I can better provide it to you.  Further, you don't need to attempt to run the game, we have a script `./scripts/watch-phaser.sh` that is already running with hot-reload for the game.

---

[Chat] Looks good! Now let's move on to the next step of our Action Plan, which is to create the Study Scene. There should be an emoji button next to any dialog (either presented by a character or as one of the Response Options of the player). Clicking this button should navigate to our Study Scene with the corresponding phrase.  We will want to be sure to carry over the furigana and translation of the phrase as well.

Once in the Study Scene, the player will be presented with the phrase in Japanese as the main focus of the scene. The player will also be able to see the furigana and translation of the phrase.  There will be a "Back" button in the top left of the scene that will take the player back to the VN Scene, which should load exactly where they left off.

I am unfamiliar with how scenes work in Phaser, so the technique for accomplishing the return may need some clarification. Is it possible to navigate to a scene while keeping an existing scene active (such that it could be returned to exactly where it was left)? If not, we may want to consider a method for using the GameState (that we have for loading/saving and currently use for the HMR functionality) to allow reloading the VNScene to exactly where it was.

Let me know your thoughts on this before we move forward.

---

Pefect, let's do that, pausing the VNScene and launching the Study Scene over it, then on return closing the Study Scene and resuming the VNScene.  There will probably be consequences for this to consider in the HMR functionality - if the game code is refreshed while in the Study Scene, perhaps it would be easiest to ignore the Study Scene and have it just reload to the appropriate place in the VNScene below it.  For now, player activity in the Study Scene can simply be forgotten in terms of saved games and hot-reloads. We will treat the study scene as ephemeral, meant only to exist temporarily when a player clicks the Study button next to a phrase.

Could you please create a new file `docs/features/Study-Scene.md` (@Study-Scene.md) that outlines the details of the Study Scene?  It would be best if we could have more details regarding this feature (as well as an Action Plan for its implementation written at the bottom of the file). See other features like `docs/features/Scene-Specific-Reloading.md` (@Scene-Specific-Reloading.md) for examples of how to write these files.  Let's also add a new item to the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file that summarizes the steps we will take to implement this, and add a [CHECKPOINT] to the end of the item.

---

This is a great start.  Let me also introduce you to our plan for integrating the LLM, which will be queried (EVENTUALLY, NOT AT THIS POINT) to populate the Study Scene with additional data regarding the focused phrases. Take a look at the `docs/features/LLM-Integration.md` file (@LLM-Integration.md) to see the type of information we will be receiving from the LLM and want to add to the Study Scene to help inform our layout and design. Update the `docs/features/Study-Scene.md` feature plan to include relevant information.

---

We have a decision to make about the HMR special case for the study scene.  On one hand, if the HMR save and restore is centrally coded, we can add the special case there (i.e., handle the save-before-HMR-reset code to save the state of the VNScene that's still active behind it). What do you think?

---

Alright, let's do it.  We'll move on to Phase 2.4 (and at the same time 2.4.1) of our Action Plan (@Action-Plan.md), which is to create the Study Scene.  Remember to use our spec plan in the `docs/features/Study-Scene.md` (@Study-Scene.md) file to guide our development.  Do not go past the [CHECKPOINT] instructions in the Action Plan.

---

The HMR edits were a complete failure.  On reload we go to the Study Scene, but according to our design it should not even be possible for 'StudyScene' to be set as the "scene" in the game state save.  The GameStateManager should only be capable of saving `TitleScene' and 'VNScene' as the scene.  How is the GameStateManager failing at detecting when we are in the Study Scene?  Please fix this.

---

It is bad design to be checking anything regarding the StudyScene on load or restoration.  This allows for there to be potential bugs in our save code.  Remove the StudyScene check from index.ts file on restoration - if we are failing to correctly save the VNScene, then we need to know about it by failing.

---

This also means the StudyScene does not need a serializeState() or deserializeState() function, correct?  because it could never be called because we are never going to save the state of this scene, but would always save the state of the VNScene behind it. Instead of removing them entirely (since it extends a StatefulScene @StatefulScene.ts ), have it make us aware of the error (exception, etc. - whatever is most appropriate for our system).

---

I conducted the following scenario:

1. Restarted the Vite server
2. Opened a fresh browser tab to http://localhost:5173 (i.e., there should be no HMR game state to restore)
3. Clicked the Start Game button to navigate to the VN Scene
4. Clicked the Study button on Kaori's first line of dialogue to navigate to the Study Scene
5. Changed a string in `phaser_game/src/scenes/TitleScene.ts` and saved to prompt an HMR event
6. Game reloads in the browser tab and flashes the Title Scene briefly before displaying the Study Scene

Here is the console log through this whole scenario:

I have updated our `@.cursorrules` file to include the following:

- Be agressive about failures. Fail at the point of failure immediately instead of creating workarounds. If a particular state or combination of variables could never occur, throw an exception or console log an error or whatever is appropriate.
- Handle external uncertainties gracefully (i.e., an API call fails, a file is not found, etc.), but be strict about internal logic. Don't create workarounds for failures in states or variables that we control internally.
- Be precise. Don't create "multiple attempts" sequences for determining a particular state or value via multiple means if one doesn't work. There should not be "fallbacks" - if a particular state or value cannot be determined as expected, throw an exception or console log an error or whatever is appropriate.

For example: Be agressive. fail at the point of failure immediately instead of creating workarounds.  For example, in GameStateManager.ts:80 we check to see if `currentScene == 'StudyScene' && vnSceneExists` and then set the proper scene - HOWEVER, it would be a bug if StudyScene is the current scene and vnSceneExists is false!  So fail there!

Why are we setting state.globalState['inStudyMode'] to true in GameStateManager.saveState() (line 97)? Why, if the Study State is never to be acknowledged at load would we want this value to be true on load? Are there other things this global state variable is used for? Why do we even track it? There is no such thing as a study state, there is simply the case that the Study Scene is active ephemerally. Why does any other scene need to know about it?

---

Yes, good call. Let's remove it entirely.  I like your insight on favoring sources of truth over additional variables that have to be tracked and maintained alongside something that is already self-verifiable. 

---

Nice, now we're getting somewhere. Here are the logs when I click the Study button on Kaori's first line of dialogue:

Excellent.  With everythinig working, let's review our `docs/features/Study-Scene.md` (@Study-Scene.md) and `docs/Action-Plan.md` files and make sure they are up-to-date.

---

I think there are probably a few more checkboxes in both files that can be checked.
 - The layout isn't final, but this is for the "core" of the scene, which appears to function.
 - We found our solution for pause/resume of the VNScene
 - The back button works for returning us to the VNScene
 - Japanese, furigana, and translation are displayed
 - We can correctly navigate to the Study Scene by clicking the Study button emoji (though its placement will need to be adjusted)
 - Study buttons appear for every piece of dialog - Kaori's statements as well as each of the player's responses
 - The focus phrase in the Study Session has always been correct, so information is being passed correctly
 - We certainly had our fun with the HMR system, but that seems to be working perfectly now.

We are building a Japanese learning app in the form of a visual novel game using Phaser and Streamlit.

(Interaction Guidelines: @Prompt-Header.md - Please remember these rules for all interactions. Any message the user sends, presume that the contents of this Prompt Header are prefixed to that message.)
(Project File Structure: @Project-File-Structure.md - Please remember this Project File Structure for determining where to find files in our project, what folders exist, etc.)
(Project Requirements Document: @PRD.md - Please remember this PRD for understanding the requirements of the project.)
(Technical Specification: @Technical-Spec.md - Please remember this Technical Specification for understanding the technical details of the project.)

(Action Plan: @Action-Plan.md - Please remember this Action Plan for understanding the plan for building the project, identifying previously completed work, identifying the current phase and upcoming [CHECKPOINT].)

Before we move on to the next phase, let's prepare some stand-in assets for the game. Consult the Project File Structure to see where we have placed background and character sprite assets. Consult the Game Design to see the locations, characters, character states, etc. that we have planned for the game.  Create stand-in assets to cover these locations and characters. Backgrounds are 1200x800 pixels and characters are 500x700 pixels.  If there are any existing assets that do not conform to these demensions, please recreate them.

---

Why do we need two copies of the images?  and why copy them over?  why did you choose to do this instead of merely creating them in their destination?  since you weren't asked to do this, i'm wondering if you were following some kind of intution or best practice.

---

OK, with our assets in place, let's move on to the next phase of our project according to our Action Plan.

---

Yes, that sounds perfect. Let's go (but keep our current work to 3.1 so i can verify manually before we move to 3.2)

---

This is great.  I like the general positioning of the characters with respect to the screen, but could we make the characters larger (true to pixel size) while still maintaining the same philosophical approach to the locations you chose originally for character placement?

--- 

Perfectly done. Can we move the characters positions strictly in the vertical direction (horizontal positions are perfect) such that the bottom of the character sprites are aligned with the bottom of the screen? The characters will be drawn at 3/4 view, with their legs going off the bottom of the screen.

---

In the Character Test Scene, the movements in position (left, center, right, offscreen) all work correctly, but the "Show" causes the character to go upward a bit and then "settle" to be in the proper vertical position, which means that they appear with their legs chopped off for just a moment as they transition in before they settle.  the upward movement is fine, but we would need to ensure the sprite never travels above the point that the bottom edge of the sprite would ever be above the bottom edge of the screen.

Excellent work, let's update the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file to reflect the completion of this phase.

---

This is great, let's move on to the 3.2 Dialog System phase of our project in the Action Plan. Before we begin coding, I would like to write a specification document at `docs/features/Dialog-System.md` that outlines the design of the dialog system (please feel free to create this file and begin populating it). Remember to reference our Game Design spec `docs/Game-Design.md` @Game-Design.md as well as our plan for integrating an LLM to source our scene content `docs/Game-LLM-Prompts` @Game-LLM-Prompts.md. 

In the near future, we will be querying an LLM with the game scene's location (e.g., restaurant, park) along with the anticipated events and transition to the next scene, and we will be asking for a series of Dialogs (called a "conversation") that will take place in the scene. Our dialog system will need to be able to manage these conversations and display individual dialogs, which consist of both the character's statement to the player and the player's response options.

[Stop] you are not supposed to implement this plan, you are supposed to WRITE THE PLAN.  This needs to be evaluated and discussed before you continue forward.  Make sure you have been thorough in the plan and indicate that you understand this message.

---

I have updated the `docs/features/Dialog-System.md` file so please review it again (@Dialog-System.md). The following are my notes following first review.  Consider the following and either answer the question or make the appropriate changes to the file:

- Ensure that our dialog system is designed to handle loading and saving (particularly in the case of HMR for now). A player should be able to load a game at any dialog within the conversation and continue with the same experience as if the game had not been interrupted.
- Does our furigana information need to be kept in the dialog (it does not appear to be currently). Perhaps that can be easily derived via a local library or from the romaji information at runtime - if so, then it's not necessary to store it in the dialog, but I wanted to be sure we had a plan for it. Whatever decision or design we go with, it should be the same both for Dialog and PlayerResponse objects.
- Making PlayerResponse optional is interesting, because it would allow for "Dialog" entries to be entirely 3rd person (such as having one character speak directly to another non-player character). Having a system where _every_ dialog is a call-and-response between an NPC and the player sounds like a simpler design, but perhaps we can take this on - we just probably want to make mention of this choice and its consequences.
- Additionally, supporting narration (where the dialog is a 3rd person monologue) further complicates our design, but it might be ok if we can make sure our LLM prompts are designed to support this. If so, to simplify, we may want to require that the first Dialog in every Conversation is a narration that sets up the scene.
- Regarding our PlayerResponse, there are no branching options in our game.  The full set of Dialogs for a Conversation are generated by the LLM at the start of the scene, and the PlayerResponse options will be neutral such that they will be narratively consistent with the next Dialog in the Conversation.  Please add this specification to both our `docs/Game-Design.md` @Game-Design.md and `docs/Game-LLM-Prompts.md` @Game-LLM-Prompts.md files as needed if this design point has not been sufficiently addressed.
- Don't worry about caching for now, let's get it working and then we can worry about optimizing it. Caching prematurally will complicate development.
- Don't worry about history yet, let's get the basic dialog working and then we can worry about that.

---

Remember our Rules (@.cursorrules). For instance, we have a guideline:

```
- Simplify and favor Sources of Truth. If a particular state of the program requires that a particular component is active, and it's possible to check that the component is active, do not have a secondary variable tracking that it is active. If we ever have a state variable that can be determined more accurately by a reliable Source of Truth, omit it.
```

Continuing the review of the `docs/features/Dialog-System.md` file and your latest updates, I have the following notes:

- It would seem that we have a secondary variable tracking whether a Dialog is a narration or a character dialog.  We should favor the Source of Truth - for example, we've noted that if the charcter ID is empty it indicates a narration, why do we risk also having an `isNarration` boolean that could become out of sync?  Consider this kind of thinking throughout the design.
- If we are going to set up that narration is mandatory for a scene, and we're going to treat it differently than a character dialog element, is it better design to leverage our existing Dialog class with "maybe" variables like `position?` and have sentinel values like an empty `characterId` as well as have the additional check and enforcement that the first Dialog in the Conversation is a narration? Or would it be better to have the narration be its own member variable in the Conversation apart from the list of Dialogs?  I'm not saying to necessarily make this change, because leveraging the existing Dialog class may keep our design simpler in the long run (i.e., its display code). But I'm asking you to consider it with knowledge of what's to come and the potential for future changes.
- We note that in our State Preservation "During development, the current dialog position, choices, and character states will be preserved when code is modified" - how are we currently storing player choices? The choices a player makes among their dialog options do not currently have any affect on the flow of Dialog in the game, but not saving these might have future implications. Remember that our state preservation must function such that a player is capable of the exact same experience on a reload as they would have had if the game had not been interrupted. This note is so important that I've added it to the Prompt Header (@Prompt-Header.md) - which we should be treating as a prefix to any note (prompt) that I (the user) give to you.
- You just ADDED a section on Caching Strategy. Was it not clear enough from my above note? : "Don't worry about caching for now, let's get it working and then we can worry about optimizing it. Caching prematurally will complicate development.".

---

These are good edits!  Final note: It may not be the case that we only care about a record of player responses for state preservation. What if we want to add a feature someday (and I'm not asking for us to do this now), where we generate a study summary or have a history of dialog (again, not now, just future-proofing)?  We would need to reference the player's responses in some way independent of our HMR or state preservation system.  I'm not saying that the current design is inccorect, just that maybe the ConversationState interface defition is more significant than its current placement in the State Preservation section.

---

Great, now that we have a foundation for this feature's design, let's add an implementation plan to the bottom of the file that will clearly denote the steps to be taken, in the appropriate order, for another developer to implement this work. Consult the feature spec douments for other features (e.g., `docs/features/State-Preservation.md` @State-Preservation.md, `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` @Phaser-Rewrite.md) for examples of how this should be done. Please create the FIP in the style of the `docs/features/Phaser-Rewrite.md` file with checkboxes and added [CHECKPOINT] areas based on your intution for natural places to stop and evaluate.

Here is an update screenshot of our Test Scene.

There are a few things to fix, but I would like to focuse on the Test Dialog System.

Right now (as shown), it opend up a dialog box in the center of the screen, but the text flows off the bottom of the dialog box.  Could we fix this by doing something like the following:
1) set up the dialog box as a scrollable area? (I don't know of Phaser easily supports this)
2) have the Test Dialog System cause the phaser app to output the dialog text to the console instead of the dialog box? There it would be scrollable and copyable via the OS terminal.
3) have the Test Dialog System output the dialog to a window on the Streamlit app, which has better support for scrolling and copyable text. (note: this might be more complicated and require us to implement a more robust Phaser-Streamlit interop through a websocket or API or something similar)

What do you think?

---

Passed [CHECKPOINT]. Let's update our `docs/features/Dialog-System.md` file to reflect the completion of this phase.

---

We don't need to update the `docs/Action-Plan.md` file to reflect the completion of this phase, because we are not yet done with this phase.

Let's move on to the next phase of our FIP.
