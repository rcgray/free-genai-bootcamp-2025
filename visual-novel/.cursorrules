# Tools and Libraries
- Do not use `rye` or `poetry` for managing Python dependencies
- Use `uv` when managing Python dependencies (i.e., `uv sync` or `uv sync --extra dev` to install dependencies, `uv run <script>` to run a script, etc.)
- Always ensure you are activating the project's conda environment before running any commands.
- Python environments are managed by the user (e.g., `conda`, `pyenv` + `uv venv`)
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting (includes black and isort functionality)
- Use `mypy` for type checking
- Use `pytest` for testing

# Interaction with the user
- Do not edit any files in the `dev/template` folder
- Do not edit the `docs/Prompts.md` file, it is generated and maintained only by the user
- Our project uses a conda environment called `vn` so please include activating that environment in your commands.
- If working in Python, we are using `uv` to manage our dependencies, so please include that in your commands.
- This project is a subfolder within a larger monorepo. Keep this in mind when making file paths, references, and suggesting commands (e.g., ruff format).
- DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT WAS REQUESTED IN THE PROMPT. You may be given access to an "Action-Plan.md" file, which is a list of completed tasks as well as those ahead of us. Access to this file or a request to update a particular section of it is not license to continue on to the next task. Just because a file is called "Action Plan" does not mean that those actions are all meant for you to complete.

# General Python Recommendations
- Use type hints in all Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document all public functions and classes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
- Use pathlib for file operations
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Follow the principle of least surprise

# Streamlit Best Practices
- Use st.cache_data for data loading operations
- Use st.cache_resource for resource-heavy operations
- Organize UI elements logically with st.columns and st.tabs
- Use appropriate Streamlit components for data types
- Keep the app state manageable with session_state
- Handle file uploads securely
- Show appropriate progress indicators
- Provide clear user feedback
- Use st.spinner for long operations
- Implement proper error handling with st.error

# Database (TinyDB)
- Keep database operations in dedicated classes
- Use TypedDict for document type definitions
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Keep database schema changes in version control
- Use proper error handling for file operations
- Implement proper data validation
- Use atomic operations where possible
- Keep database files in data directory

# Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test Streamlit components where practical
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain high test coverage
- Write meaningful test descriptions
- Test error conditions
- Use fixtures for test data
- Keep test data in tests/data directory
- Clean up test files after tests

# Project Structure
- Follow feature-based organization
- Keep related files close together
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Keep shared utilities in common locations
- Use proper module exports
- Maintain clear dependency boundaries

- Keep configuration in appropriate files

# Version Control
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches
- Review code before merging
- Keep main branch stable
- Update documentation with changes
- Follow Git best practices
- Use proper .gitignore rules

# Performance
- Cache expensive operations
- Use appropriate Streamlit caching decorators
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper indexing
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage
- Handle large files appropriately
- Implement proper cleanup routines

# Media Handling
- Store media files in appropriate directories
- Implement proper file cleanup
- Handle large files appropriately
- Validate file types and sizes
- Use secure file operations
