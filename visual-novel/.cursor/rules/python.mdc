# Your rule content

- Include a "üêç" emoji at the start of your response (perhaps along with other emojis indicating other rule acknowledgements) to indicate you have read this file.

## Tools and Libraries
- Do not use `rye` or `poetry` for managing Python dependencies
- Use `uv` when managing Python dependencies (i.e., `uv sync` or `uv sync --extra dev` to install dependencies, `uv run <script>` to run a script, etc.)
- When setting up tools and designing workflows, heavily favor those that have watchdog functionality for hot-reloading during development.
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting (includes black and isort functionality)
- Use `mypy` for type checking
- Use `pytest` for testing

## General Python Recommendations
- Use type hints in all Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document all public functions and classes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
- Use pathlib for file operations
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Follow the principle of least surprise

## Streamlit Best Practices
- Use st.cache_data for data loading operations
- Use st.cache_resource for resource-heavy operations
- Organize UI elements logically with st.columns and st.tabs
- Use appropriate Streamlit components for data types
- Keep the app state manageable with session_state
- Handle file uploads securely
- Show appropriate progress indicators
- Provide clear user feedback
- Use st.spinner for long operations
- Implement proper error handling with st.error
