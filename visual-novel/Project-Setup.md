# New Project Setup

We are setting up a new project from scratch (nature of the project will be provided later), but we have a few sample files from previous successful projects that we can use as a starting point. First, a few rules and references:

# Rules

- DO NOT EDIT ANY OF THE FILES IN THE `dev` FOLDER OR ANY OF ITS SUBFOLDERS.
- DO NOT EDIT ANY OF THE FILES IN THE `dev/template` FOLDER OR ANY OF ITS SUBFOLDERS.
- Do not populate any of the files you are creating with content, only create the files. Exceptions are noted explicitly.
- Edit this file, `Project-Setup.md`, to check off the completed actions. Since by the above rules you are not allowed to edit any files in the `dev` directory, you must copy this file to the root of the new project folder and edit that copy instead.

# References

## Template Files
These files are in the `dev/template` folder, and they also serve as a refernce for the starting structure of the new project:

```
dev/template/
├── .cursor-env
├── .cursorignore
├── .cursorrules
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── Project-Setup.md

```

## Other Notes


# Instructions

Implement the following in our new project (i.e., the root of the `dev/template` folder). Update this file to check off the completed actions:

## Step 1: File Structure Setup
- [x] Create a similar directory structure in the root of the project folder that mirrors that within our `dev/template` folder. For instance, when you are finished, there should be empty folders like `docs/reports` and `scripts`, etc

## Step 2: Copy Essential Files
- [x] Copy the following files directly to the root of the project folder:
  - [x] `.cursorignore`
  - [x] `.cursorrules`
  - [x] `.env.example`
  - [x] `.gitignore`
  - [x] `scripts/update_docs.py`

## Step 3: Documentation

### 3.1 Create Empty Files
- [x] Create the following BLANK files. Do not copy any content from the template directory, and do not add any content to the files, but rather create completely empty files:
  - [x] `docs/Action-Plan.md`
  - [x] `docs/PRD.md`
  - [x] `docs/Prompts.md`
  - [x] `docs/Technical-Spec.md`

### 3.2 Generate Empty Core Project Specifications Files
- [x] We will work together to generate the following files. Do not write these on your own, but only once we have decided what we are going to add to it. You will use the corresponding files in the `dev/template` folder (from previous projects) as a suggestion for format, but the content will be very different for this new project. I will tell you when you have finished and we can check these off.
  - [x] `docs/PRD.md` 
  - [x] `docs/Technical-Spec.md`
  - [x] `docs/Action-Plan.md`

### 3.3 Dynamic Documentation
- [ ] Depending on the nature of the project, the stack and technologies involved (Python, JavaScript, Sqlite, MongoDB, Streamlit, FastAPI, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, uv, vite, pip, mocha, ruff, mypy, pytest, etc.), certain documentation will be needed. This includes (but is not limited to) the following. Do not write these files on your own, but only once we have decided what we are going to add to it. In this case, just as with 3.2 Generating Project Specifications, you will use the corresponding files in the `dev/template` folder (from previous projects) as a suggestion for format, but the content will be very different for this new project.
  - [ ] `docs/Database-Schema.md`
  - [ ] `docs/Frontend-Design.md`
  - [ ] `docs/Backend-Technical-Spec.md`
  - [ ] `docs/Frontend-Technical-Spec.md`
  - [ ] `scripts/manage_db.py`

### 3.4 Tool Files
- [ ] Depending on the nature of the project, the stack and technologies involved (Python, JavaScript, Sqlite, MongoDB, Streamlit, FastAPI, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, uv, vite, pip, mocha, ruff, mypy, pytest, etc.), certain tool files will be needed. This includes (but is not limited to) the following. Do not write these files on your own, but only once we have decided what we are going to add to it. In this case, just as with 3.2 Generating Project Specifications, you will use the corresponding files in the `dev/template` folder (from previous projects) as a suggestion for format, but the content will be very different for this new project. Some of these files will not be manually created but rather generated by tool commands.
  - [ ] `package.json`
  - [ ] `pyproject.toml`

## Step 4: Wrap-Up
- [ ] Evaluate the previously copied files for applicability to the new project, adding or removing elements as needed:
  - [ ] `.cursorignore`
  - [ ] `.cursorrules`
  - [ ] `.env.example`
  - [ ] `.gitignore`
- [ ] Generate a `README.md` file in the root of the project folder, you can use the `README.md` file in the `dev/template` folder as a suggestion for format, but the content will be very different for this new project.
- [ ] Run the `scripts/update_docs.py` script to update the doc reports for all our newly added files.
