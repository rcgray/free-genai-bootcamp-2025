# Tools and Libraries
- Do not use `npm` or Node.js for the backend (with exception of yarn for frontend)
- Do not use `rye` or `poetry` for managing Python dependencies
- Use `uv` when managing Python dependencies (i.e., `uv sync` to install dependencies, `uv run <script>` to run a script, etc.)
- Python environments are managed by the user (e.g., `conda`, `pyenv` + `uv venv`)
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting (includes black and isort functionality)
- Use `mypy` for type checking
- Use `pytest` for testing
- Use Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

# Interaction with the user
- Do not edit any files in the `dev/template` folder
- Do not edit the `docs/Prompts.md` file, it is generated and maintained only by the user
- Do not offer to run tests, simply provide the CLI command and await results from user
- Do not offer to run database scripts, simply provide the CLI command and await results from user
- This project is a subfolder within a larger monorepo. Keep this in mind when making file paths, references, and suggesting commands (e.g., ruff format).

# General Python Recommendations
- Use type hints in all Python code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document all public functions and classes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging
- Use pathlib for file operations
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Follow the principle of least surprise

# Streamlit Best Practices
- Use st.cache_data for data loading operations
- Use st.cache_resource for resource-heavy operations
- Organize UI elements logically with st.columns and st.tabs
- Use appropriate Streamlit components for data types
- Keep the app state manageable with session_state
- Handle file uploads securely
- Show appropriate progress indicators
- Provide clear user feedback
- Use st.spinner for long operations
- Implement proper error handling with st.error

# OPEA Integration Guidelines
- Follow the OPEA documentation for API usage
- Use the ChatQnA examples as reference
- Keep model loading and inference in separate modules
- Implement proper error handling for OPEA API calls
- Use configuration files for OPEA settings
- Document model requirements and compatibility
- Implement proper cleanup of OPEA resources
- Use appropriate GPU memory settings
- Monitor GPU utilization during development

# Database (TinyDB)
- Keep database operations in dedicated classes
- Use TypedDict for document type definitions
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Keep database schema changes in version control
- Use proper error handling for file operations
- Implement proper data validation
- Use atomic operations where possible
- Keep database files in data directory

# Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test Streamlit components where practical
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Maintain high test coverage
- Write meaningful test descriptions
- Test error conditions
- Use fixtures for test data
- Keep test data in tests/data directory
- Clean up test files after tests

# Project Structure
- Follow feature-based organization
- Keep related files close together
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Keep shared utilities in common locations
- Use proper module exports

- Keep configuration in appropriate files

# Version Control
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches
- Review code before merging
- Keep main branch stable
- Update documentation with changes
- Follow Git best practices
- Use proper .gitignore rules

# Performance
- Cache expensive operations
- Use appropriate Streamlit caching decorators
- Optimize model loading and inference
- Monitor GPU memory usage
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Implement proper cleanup routines
- Optimize prompt processing
- Consider batching for multiple requests

# Docker Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Pin base image versions
- Use non-root users for security
- Set appropriate environment variables
- Mount volumes for persistent data
- Configure proper networking
- Set resource limits
- Implement health checks
- Document Docker commands

# Media Handling
- Store media files in appropriate directories
- Implement proper file cleanup
- Handle large files appropriately
- Validate file types and sizes
- Use secure file operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep media organized by type
- Use consistent naming conventions

# Documentation
- Keep README up to date
