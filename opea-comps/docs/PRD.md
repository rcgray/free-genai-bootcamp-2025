# OPEA-Based LLM Chat Application - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The OPEA-Based LLM Chat Application is a streamlined implementation of Intel's Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) toolchain to create a functional LLM-powered chat application. This application will leverage NVIDIA GPU acceleration to provide a simple yet powerful conversational AI experience without requiring the download of additional LLM models.

## Problem Statement
Implementing LLM-powered applications often involves:
- Complex configuration and deployment processes
- Challenges in model selection and integration
- Resource-intensive setup requirements
- Difficulty in creating a streamlined user experience
