We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, so now we're writing them for groups. Keep this in mind so that we can use the words code as a template. For example, @test_group_crud.py should look to @test_word_crud.py and aim to mirror it, @test_groups.py should look to @test_words.py and aim to mirror it, and so on. Even in the API and CRUD endpoints themselves this can be done, such as where @groups.py can look to @words.py and aim to mirror it.

Running the tests right now yields the following:

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.C). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions.  However, there are a few words tests we should add for completeness (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 1.C for details). Keep this in mind so that we can use the existing words code as well as the groups tests and study_sessions tests as a template. Where @test_words.py are what we should build from, feel free to examine @test_groups.py and @test_study_sessions.py and aim to mirror them for the corollary tests.

Running all tests right now yields the following:

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 3.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions CRUD and API functions.  We now want to start on our service layer tests, beginning with the Words Service (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 3.A for details). We are breaking new ground here in terms of test _type_, so though we should use the existing words, groups, and study_sessions tests as a template, we will likely want to create a new directory for our service layer tests, mirroring the existing test_crud and test_api directories.  How should we proceed?

## Frontend

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Project-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still to be written but will eventually be in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we wish to write some documentation so that we can complete the frontend.

Take a look at our @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md file and see if we can begin creating a working skeleton of an SPA frontend in React.js that would support this design.  We do not need to hook everything up to the backend API just yet, we just want to be able to launch the frontend website and navigate among the "pages" and figure out our developer tooling and workflow.  What would the project file hierarchy look like, and could we populate the @Frontend-File-Structure.md file with it?

We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we have started on the frontend, and our progress is being tracked via @AI-TODO.md.

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling.  Let's now proceed with the next step in the @AI-TODO.md document (Step 2. Set up Configuration Files).



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. The full file structure is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.

I would like to update the @Backend-File-Structure.md file with the current file structure of the _backend_ project, containing only the files that are currently present in the backend project and some extra information similar to how @Frontend-File-Structure.md is written.
