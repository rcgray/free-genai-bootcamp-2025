We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, so now we're writing them for groups. Keep this in mind so that we can use the words code as a template. For example, @test_group_crud.py should look to @test_word_crud.py and aim to mirror it, @test_groups.py should look to @test_words.py and aim to mirror it, and so on. Even in the API and CRUD endpoints themselves this can be done, such as where @groups.py can look to @words.py and aim to mirror it.

Running the tests right now yields the following:

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 3.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions CRUD and API functions.  We now want to start on our service layer tests, beginning with the Words Service (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 3.A for details). We are breaking new ground here in terms of test _type_, so though we should use the existing words, groups, and study_sessions tests as a template, we will likely want to create a new directory for our service layer tests, mirroring the existing test_crud and test_api directories.  How should we proceed?

## Frontend

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Project-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still to be written but will eventually be in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we wish to write some documentation so that we can complete the frontend.

Take a look at our @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md file and see if we can begin creating a working skeleton of an SPA frontend in React.js that would support this design.  We do not need to hook everything up to the backend API just yet, we just want to be able to launch the frontend website and navigate among the "pages" and figure out our developer tooling and workflow.  What would the project file hierarchy look like, and could we populate the @Frontend-File-Structure.md file with it?



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we have started on the frontend, and our progress is being tracked via @AI-TODO.md.

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling.  Let's now proceed with the next step in the @AI-TODO.md document (Step 2. Set up Configuration Files).



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. The full file structure is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.

When creating our backend, we accidentally split the code base between two different directories - the intended directory (./backend-fastapi/app) and the accidental outside directory (./app), so we need to fix that.  We want to move all the backend files into the backend-fastapi directory under ./backend-fastapi/app, and we want to update the @Backend-File-Structure.md file.

We also want to make sure that any files in the backend are updated to reflect the new directory structure, if any of them depended on the specific path of the files that were incorrectly placed in the ./app directory.



We are creating an SPA with a React.js frontend: the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md.  Note that these files are contained within the "frontend-react/" folder off our project root (i.e., @frontend-react ), and where this frontend implementation fits in with the larger project can be seen in the overall project file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md .

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling. However, right now our pages simply display the name of the page to the browser. In our @AI-TODO.md document, we are on step 6. Create the SPA template, and we want to proceed with that step.  Help me to design a basic template for our frontend using TailwindCSS.  For now, let's add a navigation bar to the left side of the page that displays the name of the page we are on, and a main content area that displays the name of the page.

As we flesh out our design, please add our design description and decisions to the (currently empty) file @Frontend-Design.md.

Our latest issue is an error in the backend when the frontend words page is loaded and hits the words API endpoint.  The error (in the backend) is:

when i run `tree -a --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md` from the root of the project, it should create a file tree of the entire project while observing ignored files specified by the `.gitignore` file (@.gitignore) and save the output in `docs/Project-File-Structure.md` (attached).  However, even though we ignore files in  __pycache_ directories throughout the project, we are not successfully ignoring the files in `frontend-react/node_modules` - however, our git status does successfully ignore them, leading me to believe that our .gitignore file is set up correctly and that this is a problem with the `tree` program interpreting the `--gitignore` flag.  Do you have any insight into this?  How can we get the `tree` program to ignore the `frontend-react/node-modules` folder successfully just like it is properly ignoring files within `__pycache__` directories?




We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend. The backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md (files: @backend-fastapi), and the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md (files: @frontend-react), and the full file structure is currently (via `tree -a > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) in @Project-File-Structure.md.

There is a seed file for the study_activities table in the backend-fastapi/seed directory, and I have updated it to include two new fields for the study_activity record: image_url and description.  We need to update our schema definition in our docs `docs/Backend-Technical-Spec.md` for the study_activities table to include these two new fields, which will also mean updating our code for the study_activities table (CRUD, and perhaps service layer, models, and schemas). We do not yet have an API endpoint, but we will do that in a later step, as well as create the necessary tests in a future step.

Reference the `docs/Project-File-Structure.md` file to locate the files you need to read and/or update. Here are a few that might be relevant:
 - Study Activity seed file: `backend-fastapi/seed/study_activities.json`
 - Study Activity model: `backend-fastapi/app/models/study_activity.py`
 - Study Activity schema: Not Yet Created (do we need one?) - if needed, it should be created in the `backend-fastapi/app/schemas/` folder
 - Study Activity CRUD: Not Yet Created (do we need one?) - if needed, it should be created in the `backend-fastapi/app/crud/` folder





We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.  We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md`.  Right now, our project uses alembic to manage migrations, but we are early in the development process and have not yet created any migrations.  We can delete the existing migrations, but we do have two files that aid in the creation of the database and initial seeding for a new deployment and also for testing.  These files are:

- `scripts/create_db.py` - this file contains the code for creating the database
- `scripts/seed_db.py` - this file contains the code for seeding the database

Additionally, we have a `backend-fastapi/seed/` directory that contains the seed data for the database.

What changes do we need to make to these files to create our new database?





We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md .

We are now extending our `activities` table of the database to be supported by our backend, including a new GET api endpoint that fetches all activities.  We need to update our backend codebase to support this new endpoint, including the necessary models, schemas, CRUD, and tests.

We have recently changed what was our study_sessions table in the database (@Database-Schema.md ) to simply `sessions`, and we adjusted the project downstream from that, changing all mentions (including class names, tests, endpoints, etc.) to remove the "study_" prefix.  Now we have just updated our schema to have the `study_activities` to become `activities` and we need to change all the downstream aspects of this throughout the codebase.  Note that in our current implementation, we had previously referred to this table as "study" (e.g. backend-fastapi/app/services/study_service.py), and all of the other things (classes, endpoints, tests, etc.) named "study" will need to be changed to "activity" - can you search the backend codebase and find where these items might be and replace them?


We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md .  All backend tests are passing.

We have recently changed what was our study_sessions table in the database (@Database-Schema.md ) to simply `sessions`, and we have changed study_activities to `activities` and we adjusted the project downstream from that, changing all mentions (including class names, tests, endpoints, etc.) to remove the "study_" prefix. We would like to echo this forward into the frontend. Any class, url path, api call, etc. that mentions "study activity" (or some variant) should be changed to "activity".




We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md. The backend code is in the subdirectory `backend-fastapi`, and the frontend code is in the subdirectory `frontend-react`. We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md`. All backend tests are passing.

I would like to review some of our documentation files to make sure they are up to date and accurate. We have recently made some significant changes to the code and database, including renaming a field called "study_sessions" to "sessions" and "study_activities" to "activities". Please take a look at the following files and make sure they are up to date:

- `docs/Backend-Technical-Spec.md`
- `docs/Frontend-Technical-Spec.md`
- `docs/Frontend-Design.md`



Importantly, I would like us to examine @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and compare it to our actual code in the backend-fastapi directory.  For instance, the API endpoints in backend-fastapi/app/api/v1/ are not consistent with the API endpoints described in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md.  Can you examine the code and the spec and make sure they match?

Also, here is a file @API-Summary.md . It is currently empty, but let's populate it with a summary of the API endpoints that we have implemented so far.  We can use this file to help us keep track of the API endpoints and their descriptions as we add them.


Now let's take a look at the @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md file and perform a similar review. The actual code for the frontend is in the frontend-react directory, and the file hierarchy is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md. Let us look at the actual components and pages that are implemented in the frontend-react directory and make whatever changes to @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md that are needed to match the actual code.



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md. The backend code is in the subdirectory `backend-fastapi`, and the frontend code is in the subdirectory `frontend-react`. We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md` with summary of API endpoints in `docs/API-Summary.md`. All backend tests are passing and the frontend runs great.

I would like to create a set of activities (most of them "games") that I can develop as separate projects but are launched within this app.  These games will run in the browser and will be launched from the activities page.  Being part of the app, they will have the ability to use the app's backend API, and they will be able to use the app's database through that API, such as POST /api/sessions to create a new session record and subsequently POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/review to log a review attempt for a word while the user plays the game.

Before we begin, I need some help planning how to structure these sub-projects within the monoproject repository.  Here are some of the things I need to consider:

- These games will be written in React.js, and will be launched from the activities page.
- Other libraries, such as Phaser, might be used to develop some of them, but not necessarily all.
- These games will be developed as separate projects, but will be launched from the activities page.
- The games should be standalone projects that function even when the frontend app is not running.
- The projects in which the games are developed should be able to run independently of the frontend app, including dev libraries and tooling,but there should be an easy way to deploy the final code such that the frontend can use it if the game is enabled in the database.
- The games should be able to be added and removed frequently, where the games list is managed by the activities table in the database. The frontend should be flexible enough to allow for this.
- The games should still live within this monoproject repository.
- The games should be played from within a page on this app (perhaps something like /activities/game-name), whether via an iframe or a new tab/window.
- The games should be able to use the app's database through the backend API.
- The games should be able to use the app's backend API to create new session records and log review attempts for words.

Questions about the organization of the games:

- Where should the code for the game projects live? (perhaps a new games directory off the project root?)
- How do games integrate with the frontend when they are enabled? How does the frontend "see" the game code and run it?  Does it have to be manually copied into the frontend-react directory, or can the frontend app reference the game code dynamically?
- What are the industry best practices for handling this kind of scenario?



alright, we are ready to rock on kanji-snake.  moving away from base-game, we have our games/kanji-snake directory.  everything is running great and i'm working in development mode (`yarn dev`) with live refresh.  i would like to make the game specified in @Game-Kanji-Snake.md




so now let's start adding kanji to the field.  i know that integration with the backend API is a later step, so for now you can work with the following words as we develop, along with their (romaji) readings:
 - Èñã„Åë„Çã (akeru)
 - Âëº„Å∂ (yobu)
 - ÂÉç„Åè (hataraku)
 - ÁµÇ„Çè„Çã (owaru)
 - ‰ºë„ÇÄ (yasumu)
 - ÈÄÅ„Çã (okuru)
 - È£ü„Åπ„Çã (taberu)
 - Ë¶ã„Çã (miru)




similar to our great @update_docs.py dev script success, let's create another right alongside it called reset_db.py.  in this script, delete the databases "lang_portal.db" and "empty.db" in the `data/` folder and report that these two files no longer exist in the `data/` folder, run `scripts/db/init_db.py` and report its success. if it failed, stop the script.  then, run `scripts/db/seed_db.py` and report its success.  if it failed, stop the script.  then copy the newly created `data/lang_portal.db` file to `data/empty.db` and confirm that both the newly created and seeded database as well as the new empty copy of that database exist.




We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md. The backend code is in the subdirectory `backend-fastapi`, and the frontend code is in the subdirectory `frontend-react`. We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md` with summary of API endpoints in `docs/API-Summary.md`. All backend tests are passing and the frontend runs great.

Our current subtask is to create a game to be played in the frontend.We are creating a "snake" game in Phaser, called Kanji Snake, with our design laid out in `docs/Game-Kanji-Snake.md`.  We have a basic snake game working with kanji appering in the field, and we started moving to Phase 2. We got interrupted due to sessions requiring a group_id, which is not what we intended to design. Specifically, players are allowed to select "all groups" and then play the game with all words in the database (not necessarily part of a group).

Let's take a look at our code in the games/kanji-snake directory and figure out where we are with respect to the Phase 2 design, update our design document `docs/Game-Kanji-Snake.md` to reflect our current design, and then proceed with the next step in our design document.


Our current issue: clicking on the 'Start Game' (regardless of which word group is selected, including the meta-group "All Words") hits a 404 not found on the backend.  the backend also reports this error: ``INFO:     127.0.0.1:34706 - "POST /api/sessions HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`.  Keep in mind that our frontend has no problem accessing the backend server and all our backend tests (including those for API endpoints and sessions) are passing.  We don't want to change the backend code, so let's update the kanji-snake game code to fix this issue.





Investigate the game as written in the games/kanji-snake directory. Somewhere along the way our method for establishing a new session has gone wrong.  We need to figure out where and fix it.

Here is the output of the backend server when clicking on the 'Start New Session' button in the dev console:
```

```

I'm further concerned by the fact that this error contains mention of 'typing-tutor' in the error message.  This is not the name of our current game ('kanji-snake').  Let's investigate.

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/activities?page=1&per_page=25&sort_by=name&order=asc' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```
The backend simply reports:
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:60698 - "GET /api/activities?page=1&per_page=25&sort_by=name&order=asc HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```




Our project files are currently listed in@Project-File-Structure.md . Following the instructions in the @README.md and the @Game-Harness-Spec.md and the @Games-Feature-Spec.md files, we have a new game that we've created in the games directory (`games/kanji-snake`). We now want to deploy this game to the frontend, and we have instructions to run `yarn dev:games` to build the game. This ultimately calls `scripts/build-games.js` to build the game and then copies the built game to the frontend's public directory (`frontend-react/public/games`), for example, our game in `games/kanji-snake` will be built and copied to `frontend-react/public/games/kanji-snake.js`.

When the user visits the activities page, they are greeted with a list of activities. When they click on the "Launch Activity" button for our game, the user neviates to the frontend route at /activities/game-name (e.g., /activities/kanji-snake) and the game is loaded and displayed on that page.

There have been some challenges with getting the game to load properly, however, and this is due to the complexity of wanting the game project (`/games/kanji-snake`) to be a standalone project that can be developed independently of the frontend app.  We want to be able to run the game project independently of the frontend app, including dev libraries and tooling, but there should be an easy way to deploy the final code (via the `yarn dev:games` command calling the `scripts/build-games.js` file) such that the frontend can present the game to the user.

Early issues were around the React library not being available to the project, and changes were made to allow this.  However, we are now seeing an error when the game is loaded. So we need to investigate several things:

- The nature of the separation between the frontend and the game project, including the shared code library (in /shared) that is used by both projects.
- The nature of the build process and the deployment of the built game to the frontend's public directory.
- The method by which the game is loaded and displayed on the activities page.





In our old system, a game would have a single image ("thumbnail.jpg") in the games/game-name/assets directory.  This image was copied to the frontend's public directory (frontend-react/public/games/images) and then referenced in the frontend-react/src/types/assets.d.ts file.



There is now an error in the browser window for the hosting page: "Failed to load game module: kanji-snake - Failed to resolve module specifier '@assets/games/kanji-snake.js?url'" and we see the following in the hosted page console:
```
Starting to load game: kanji-snake
[id].tsx:67 Attempting to load game module from: @assets/games/kanji-snake.js?url
[id].tsx:82 Detailed game loading error: TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier '@assets/games/kanji-snake.js?url'
    at loadGame ([id].tsx:68:41)
    at [id].tsx:87:5
```
The call for @assets/games/kanji-snake.js?url' seems odd to me, both because the js file alone should be sufficient and because it ends in a single quote.





We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md. The backend code is in the subdirectory `backend-fastapi`, and the frontend code is in the subdirectory `frontend-react`. We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md` with summary of API endpoints in `docs/API-Summary.md`.

We have made some changes to our backend to accommodate a new frontend feature, and we need to ensure that all of our backend tests are passing.  Running `uv run pytest backend-fastapi/tests/` reports the following (summary):

let's look at our capture code - when we capture or "eat" a word (by hitting any character that word), we want a few things to happen:
- the entire word (all characters for the word that was hit) will flash a color and fade out completely.
- if the captured word was the target word
  - flash the word in green and fade out completely. the word is no longer interactable.
  - log a review attempt for the target word with correct=true.
  - increase the player's score (and also update the score display on the screen, we can use plain text for now)
  - start a new target word:
    - choose a new target word and display its romaji
    - clear the field of all existing words
    - populate the field with new words randomly from the words list, with only one word being the new target word. there should be no duplicates
- if the captured word was NOT the target word
  - flash the word in red and fade out completely. the word is no longer interactable.
  - log a review attempt for the target word with correct=false.
  - add a strike to the player's count (and also display the strike count on the screen in the upper right corner, we can use the character ‚ùå for the strike icon). three strikes and the game is over.
