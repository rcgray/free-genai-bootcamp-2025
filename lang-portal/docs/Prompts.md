We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, so now we're writing them for groups. Keep this in mind so that we can use the words code as a template. For example, @test_group_crud.py should look to @test_word_crud.py and aim to mirror it, @test_groups.py should look to @test_words.py and aim to mirror it, and so on. Even in the API and CRUD endpoints themselves this can be done, such as where @groups.py can look to @words.py and aim to mirror it.

Running the tests right now yields the following:

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.C). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions.  However, there are a few words tests we should add for completeness (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 1.C for details). Keep this in mind so that we can use the existing words code as well as the groups tests and study_sessions tests as a template. Where @test_words.py are what we should build from, feel free to examine @test_groups.py and @test_study_sessions.py and aim to mirror them for the corollary tests.

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 3.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions CRUD and API functions.  We now want to start on our service layer tests, beginning with the Words Service (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 3.A for details). We are breaking new ground here in terms of test _type_, so though we should use the existing words, groups, and study_sessions tests as a template, we will likely want to create a new directory for our service layer tests, mirroring the existing test_crud and test_api directories.  How should we proceed?

## Frontend

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Project-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still to be written but will eventually be in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we wish to write some documentation so that we can complete the frontend.

Take a look at our @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md file and see if we can begin creating a working skeleton of an SPA frontend in React.js that would support this design.  We do not need to hook everything up to the backend API just yet, we just want to be able to launch the frontend website and navigate among the "pages" and figure out our developer tooling and workflow.  What would the project file hierarchy look like, and could we populate the @Frontend-File-Structure.md file with it?



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we have started on the frontend, and our progress is being tracked via @AI-TODO.md.

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling.  Let's now proceed with the next step in the @AI-TODO.md document (Step 2. Set up Configuration Files).



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. The full file structure is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.

When creating our backend, we accidentally split the code base between two different directories - the intended directory (./backend-fastapi/app) and the accidental outside directory (./app), so we need to fix that.  We want to move all the backend files into the backend-fastapi directory under ./backend-fastapi/app, and we want to update the @Backend-File-Structure.md file.

We also want to make sure that any files in the backend are updated to reflect the new directory structure, if any of them depended on the specific path of the files that were incorrectly placed in the ./app directory.



We are creating an SPA with a React.js frontend: the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md.  Note that these files are contained within the "frontend-react/" folder off our project root (i.e., @frontend-react ), and where this frontend implementation fits in with the larger project can be seen in the overall project file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md .

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling. However, right now our pages simply display the name of the page to the browser. In our @AI-TODO.md document, we are on step 6. Create the SPA template, and we want to proceed with that step.  Help me to design a basic template for our frontend using TailwindCSS.  For now, let's add a navigation bar to the left side of the page that displays the name of the page we are on, and a main content area that displays the name of the page.

As we flesh out our design, please add our design description and decisions to the (currently empty) file @Frontend-Design.md.

Our latest issue is an error in the backend when the frontend words page is loaded and hits the words API endpoint.  The error (in the backend) is:
