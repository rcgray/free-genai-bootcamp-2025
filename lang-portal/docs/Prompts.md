We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 1.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, so now we're writing them for groups. Keep this in mind so that we can use the words code as a template. For example, @test_group_crud.py should look to @test_word_crud.py and aim to mirror it, @test_groups.py should look to @test_words.py and aim to mirror it, and so on. Even in the API and CRUD endpoints themselves this can be done, such as where @groups.py can look to @words.py and aim to mirror it.

Running the tests right now yields the following:

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend (spec and schema in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md and file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md), and we're currently writing tests (see @AI-TODO.md, where we are on tests 3.A). Our DB is all set up, and we already have great tests running perfectly for words, groups, and study_sessions CRUD and API functions.  We now want to start on our service layer tests, beginning with the Words Service (see the @AI-TODO.md file section 3.A for details). We are breaking new ground here in terms of test _type_, so though we should use the existing words, groups, and study_sessions tests as a template, we will likely want to create a new directory for our service layer tests, mirroring the existing test_crud and test_api directories.  How should we proceed?

## Frontend

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Project-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still to be written but will eventually be in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we wish to write some documentation so that we can complete the frontend.

Take a look at our @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md file and see if we can begin creating a working skeleton of an SPA frontend in React.js that would support this design.  We do not need to hook everything up to the backend API just yet, we just want to be able to launch the frontend website and navigate among the "pages" and figure out our developer tooling and workflow.  What would the project file hierarchy look like, and could we populate the @Frontend-File-Structure.md file with it?



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. We have created our database, implemented our backend, and we have written our tests. Now we have started on the frontend, and our progress is being tracked via @AI-TODO.md.

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling.  Let's now proceed with the next step in the @AI-TODO.md document (Step 2. Set up Configuration Files).



We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend: the backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md, project file hierarchy for the backend is in @Backend-File-Structure.md, the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md. The full file structure is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.

When creating our backend, we accidentally split the code base between two different directories - the intended directory (./backend-fastapi/app) and the accidental outside directory (./app), so we need to fix that.  We want to move all the backend files into the backend-fastapi directory under ./backend-fastapi/app, and we want to update the @Backend-File-Structure.md file.

We also want to make sure that any files in the backend are updated to reflect the new directory structure, if any of them depended on the specific path of the files that were incorrectly placed in the ./app directory.



We are creating an SPA with a React.js frontend: the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md, and the file hierarchy for the frontend is still being constructed but will eventually be similar to what is described in @Frontend-File-Structure.md.  Note that these files are contained within the "frontend-react/" folder off our project root (i.e., @frontend-react ), and where this frontend implementation fits in with the larger project can be seen in the overall project file hierarchy in @Project-File-Structure.md .

We have our skeleton React.js app set up and running along with Vite and other tooling. However, right now our pages simply display the name of the page to the browser. In our @AI-TODO.md document, we are on step 6. Create the SPA template, and we want to proceed with that step.  Help me to design a basic template for our frontend using TailwindCSS.  For now, let's add a navigation bar to the left side of the page that displays the name of the page we are on, and a main content area that displays the name of the page.

As we flesh out our design, please add our design description and decisions to the (currently empty) file @Frontend-Design.md.

Our latest issue is an error in the backend when the frontend words page is loaded and hits the words API endpoint.  The error (in the backend) is:

when i run `tree -a --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md` from the root of the project, it should create a file tree of the entire project while observing ignored files specified by the `.gitignore` file (@.gitignore) and save the output in `docs/Project-File-Structure.md` (attached).  However, even though we ignore files in  __pycache_ directories throughout the project, we are not successfully ignoring the files in `frontend-react/node_modules` - however, our git status does successfully ignore them, leading me to believe that our .gitignore file is set up correctly and that this is a problem with the `tree` program interpreting the `--gitignore` flag.  Do you have any insight into this?  How can we get the `tree` program to ignore the `frontend-react/node-modules` folder successfully just like it is properly ignoring files within `__pycache__` directories?




We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend. The backend spec and database schema are in @Backend-Technical-Spec.md (files: @backend-fastapi), and the frontend spec is in @Frontend-Technical-Spec.md (files: @frontend-react), and the full file structure is currently (via `tree -a > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) in @Project-File-Structure.md.

There is a seed file for the study_activities table in the backend-fastapi/seed directory, and I have updated it to include two new fields for the study_activity record: image_url and description.  We need to update our schema definition in our docs `docs/Backend-Technical-Spec.md` for the study_activities table to include these two new fields, which will also mean updating our code for the study_activities table (CRUD, and perhaps service layer, models, and schemas). We do not yet have an API endpoint, but we will do that in a later step, as well as create the necessary tests in a future step.

Reference the `docs/Project-File-Structure.md` file to locate the files you need to read and/or update. Here are a few that might be relevant:
 - Study Activity seed file: `backend-fastapi/seed/study_activities.json`
 - Study Activity model: `backend-fastapi/app/models/study_activity.py`
 - Study Activity schema: Not Yet Created (do we need one?) - if needed, it should be created in the `backend-fastapi/app/schemas/` folder
 - Study Activity CRUD: Not Yet Created (do we need one?) - if needed, it should be created in the `backend-fastapi/app/crud/` folder





We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md.  We have a database schema defined in `docs/Database-Schema.md`.  Right now, our project uses alembic to manage migrations, but we are early in the development process and have not yet created any migrations.  We can delete the existing migrations, but we do have two files that aid in the creation of the database and initial seeding for a new deployment and also for testing.  These files are:

- `scripts/create_db.py` - this file contains the code for creating the database
- `scripts/seed_db.py` - this file contains the code for seeding the database

Additionally, we have a `backend-fastapi/seed/` directory that contains the seed data for the database.

What changes do we need to make to these files to create our new database?





We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md .

We are now extending our `activities` table of the database to be supported by our backend, including a new GET api endpoint that fetches all activities.  We need to update our backend codebase to support this new endpoint, including the necessary models, schemas, CRUD, and tests.

We have recently changed what was our study_sessions table in the database (@Database-Schema.md ) to simply `sessions`, and we adjusted the project downstream from that, changing all mentions (including class names, tests, endpoints, etc.) to remove the "study_" prefix.  Now we have just updated our schema to have the `study_activities` to become `activities` and we need to change all the downstream aspects of this throughout the codebase.  Note that in our current implementation, we had previously referred to this table as "study" (e.g. backend-fastapi/app/services/study_service.py), and all of the other things (classes, endpoints, tests, etc.) named "study" will need to be changed to "activity" - can you search the backend codebase and find where these items might be and replace them?


--- future prompts ---

We are creating an SPA with a FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend, and our file hierarchy (`$ tree -e --gitignore > docs/Project-File-Structure.md`) is currently in @Project-File-Structure.md .  All backend tests are passing.

We have recently changed what was our study_sessions table in the database (@Database-Schema.md ) to simply `sessions`, and we have changed study_activities to `activities` and we adjusted the project downstream from that, changing all mentions (including class names, tests, endpoints, etc.) to remove the "study_" prefix. We would like to echo this forward into the frontend. Any class, url path, api call, etc. that mentions "study activity" (or some variant) should be changed to "activity".
