# Frontend Development Plan

We have created a comprehensive file structure for the frontend that aligns with the technical specifications and follows React best practices. The structure supports all the required functionality while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

Below is our step-by-step plan for implementing the frontend:

## 1. Initialize Vite Project with React and TypeScript
- [x] Create new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
  ```bash
  yarn create vite frontend-react --template react-ts
  ```
- [x] Add essential dependencies:
  - react-router-dom
  - @tanstack/react-query
  - axios
  - clsx
  - @headlessui/react (for accessible UI components)
  - @heroicons/react (for icons)
- [x] Set up development dependencies:
  - typescript
  - @types/* packages
  - vitest and testing libraries
- [x] Clean up default Vite template files:
  - [x] Remove App.css
  - [x] Clean up index.css
  - [x] Update App.tsx
  - [x] Clean up main.tsx
  - [x] Remove unnecessary assets
- [x] Update package.json with project details
- [x] Create initial README.md with setup instructions

## 2. Set up Configuration Files
- [x] ESLint Configuration

- [x] Set up basic layouts
  - [x] MainLayout with navigation and footer
  - [x] StudyLayout for study sessions
- [x] Create essential utility files
  - [x] API client setup
  - [x] Type definitions
  - [x] Common utilities
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure
  - [x] Configure Vitest
  - [x] Set up MSW for API mocking
  - [x] Create test utilities

## 4. Set up TailwindCSS
- [x] Install TailwindCSS and dependencies
  ```bash
  yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  ```
- [x] Initialize Tailwind configuration
  ```bash

  ```
- [x] Configure tailwind.config.js
  - [x] Set up content paths
  - [x] Define color palette
  - [x] Configure theme extensions
  - [x] Set up dark mode

- [x] Set up PostCSS configuration
- [x] Create basic design system
  - [x] Colors
  - [x] Typography
  - [x] Spacing
  - [x] Breakpoints
- [x] Create reusable component classes

## 5. Create Basic Routing Structure
- [x] Set up React Router
  - [x] Install dependencies
  - [x] Configure router instance
- [x] Create route definitions
  - [x] Home route (/)
  - [x] Words route (/words)
  - [x] Groups route (/groups)
  - [x] Study Activities route (/activities)
  - [x] Settings route (/settings)
  - [x] Error route (404 and other error states)
- [x] Implement layouts
  - [x] Create layout components
  - [x] Set up layout routes
  - [x] Add error boundary for route errors
- [x] Create basic page components
  - [x] HomePage
  - [x] WordsPage
  - [x] GroupsPage
  - [x] StudyActivitiesPage
  - [x] SettingsPage
  - [x] ErrorPage
- [x] Set up navigation
  - [x] Create Navigation component
  - [x] Implement navigation links
  - [x] Add active state styling
  - [x] Ensure navigation works with error states
