# Frontend Development Plan

We have created a comprehensive file structure for the frontend that aligns with the technical specifications and follows React best practices. The structure supports all the required functionality while maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

Below is our step-by-step plan for implementing the frontend:

## 1. Initialize Vite Project with React and TypeScript
- [ ] Create new Vite project with React and TypeScript template
  ```bash
  yarn create vite frontend-react --template react-ts
  ```
- [ ] Clean up default Vite template files
- [ ] Update package.json with project details
- [ ] Add essential dependencies:
  - react-router-dom
  - @tanstack/react-query
  - axios
  - clsx
  - @headlessui/react (for accessible UI components)
  - @heroicons/react (for icons)
- [ ] Set up development dependencies:
  - typescript
  - @types/* packages
  - vitest and testing libraries
- [ ] Create initial README.md with setup instructions

## 2. Set up Configuration Files
- [ ] ESLint Configuration
  - [ ] Install ESLint and plugins
  - [ ] Configure .eslintrc.js with React and TypeScript rules
  - [ ] Add lint scripts to package.json
- [ ] Prettier Configuration
  - [ ] Install Prettier
  - [ ] Create .prettierrc with project formatting rules
  - [ ] Add format scripts to package.json
- [ ] TypeScript Configuration
  - [ ] Configure tsconfig.json with strict settings
  - [ ] Set up path aliases
  - [ ] Configure type checking
- [ ] Vite Configuration
  - [ ] Set up vite.config.ts with plugins
  - [ ] Configure build options
  - [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Git Configuration
  - [ ] Update .gitignore
  - [ ] Set up Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - [ ] Configure lint-staged

## 3. Create Initial Project Structure
- [ ] Set up directory structure as defined in Frontend-File-Structure.md
- [ ] Create placeholder files for key components
- [ ] Set up basic layouts
  - [ ] MainLayout with navigation and footer
  - [ ] StudyLayout for study sessions
- [ ] Create essential utility files
  - [ ] API client setup
  - [ ] Type definitions
  - [ ] Common utilities
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
  - [ ] Configure Vitest
  - [ ] Set up MSW for API mocking
  - [ ] Create test utilities

## 4. Set up TailwindCSS
- [ ] Install TailwindCSS and dependencies
  ```bash
  yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  ```
- [ ] Initialize Tailwind configuration
  ```bash
  yarn tailwindcss init -p
  ```
- [ ] Configure tailwind.config.js
  - [ ] Set up content paths
  - [ ] Define color palette
  - [ ] Configure theme extensions
  - [ ] Set up dark mode
- [ ] Create base CSS file with Tailwind directives
- [ ] Set up PostCSS configuration
- [ ] Create basic design system
  - [ ] Colors
  - [ ] Typography
  - [ ] Spacing
  - [ ] Breakpoints
- [ ] Create reusable component classes

## 5. Create Basic Routing Structure
- [ ] Set up React Router
  - [ ] Install dependencies
  - [ ] Configure router instance
- [ ] Create route definitions
  - [ ] Home route (/)
  - [ ] Words route (/words)
  - [ ] Groups route (/groups)
  - [ ] Study Activities route (/activities)
  - [ ] Settings route (/settings)
- [ ] Implement layouts
  - [ ] Create layout components
  - [ ] Set up layout routes
- [ ] Create basic page components
  - [ ] HomePage
  - [ ] WordsPage
  - [ ] GroupsPage
  - [ ] StudyActivitiesPage
  - [ ] SettingsPage
- [ ] Set up navigation
  - [ ] Create Navigation component
  - [ ] Implement navigation links
  - [ ] Add active state styling

## Next Steps After Initial Setup
1. Implement core features:
   - [ ] Word management
   - [ ] Group management
   - [ ] Study session handling
   - [ ] Progress tracking

2. Add advanced features:
   - [ ] Theme switching
   - [ ] Data persistence
   - [ ] Error handling
   - [ ] Loading states

3. Polish and optimize:
   - [ ] Performance optimization
   - [ ] Accessibility improvements
   - [ ] Animation and transitions
   - [ ] Cross-browser testing

4. Testing and documentation:
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Component documentation
   - [ ] User documentation

Each step should be completed and tested before moving on to the next one. We'll track our progress by checking off completed items and adding any additional tasks that arise during development.
