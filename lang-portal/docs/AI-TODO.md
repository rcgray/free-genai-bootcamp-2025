Based on my analysis of the codebase and specifications, here are the key missing components and inconsistencies that need to be addressed:
1. Missing API Endpoints
  - The words.py endpoint file exists but needs implementation for:
    - POST /api/words (create word)
    - PUT /api/words/:id (update word)
    - DELETE /api/words/:id (delete word)
  - These endpoints are not specified in the Backend-Technical-Spec.md but would be necessary for a complete CRUD interface.
2. Missing CRUD Operations
  - While we have the base CRUD class implemented, we need specific implementations for:
    - word.py (partially implemented)
    - group.py
    - study_session.py
3. Database Migrations
  - The alembic/versions/ directory appears empty
  - We need initial migration scripts to create all tables defined in the schema
  - The database schema is well-defined in the spec but not yet implemented
4. Service Layer
  - study_service.py exists but needs full implementation
  - Missing word_service.py and group_service.py implementations
  - The service layer architecture isn't clearly defined in the spec
5. Test Coverage
  - Need to implement:
    - test_groups.py
    - test_study_sessions.py
  - Current test files need more comprehensive test cases
6. Environment Configuration
  - Missing .env file with configuration (though we have config.py)
  - Need .env.example for documentation
  - Database URL configuration needs to be specified
7. Dependencies
  - pyproject.toml exists but we need to verify all required dependencies are listed:
    - FastAPI
    - SQLAlchemy
    - Alembic
    - Pydantic
    - aiosqlite (for async SQLite)
    - pytest and related testing packages
8. Documentation
  - API documentation in endpoint functions needs to be completed
  - Missing detailed setup instructions in README.md
  - Need to document error handling and response formats
