# Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025

A collection of generative AI tools and applications designed to enhance language learning experiences. This repository contains multiple projects that leverage AI to create interactive and effective language learning solutions.

## Projects

### Language Learning Portal (`/lang-portal`)

A web application that serves as:
- A vocabulary management system
- A learning record store (LRS)
- A unified launchpad for various learning applications

Built with FastAPI (Python), React, and SQLite, this portal acts as the central hub for all learning activities and progress tracking.

### Sentence Constructor (`/sentence-constructor`)

An AI-powered tool that helps students construct grammatically correct sentences in their target language. Features include:
- Interactive sentence building exercises
- Progressive difficulty levels

### Architecture Documentation (`/genai-architecting`)

Technical documentation and architectural designs for the GenAI language learning ecosystem, including:
- System architecture diagrams
- Design decisions and rationale
- Integration specifications
